# Aegolith

## From the Depths of [[Eides]]

Aegolith was first discovered during the construction of the bulwarks at the beginning of the Age of Bulwarks, when previously barely explored areas were searched for new building materials with special properties. Dwarves were primarily commissioned for this task, working together with some of the greatest architects and master builders of the time. During the first [[Devil's Hole]] expedition, a team of dwarves explored exactly this. In the depths, far from daylight, they encountered a strange material in the walls of the abyss that they had never seen before.

## Properties

Aegolith itself looks deceptively similar to amber, but in nature it occurs almost exclusively with a deep black protective layer.
This protective layer, also called pitch stone, is formed when Aegolith comes into contact with rock. This reaction releases a large amount of heat and gases. Between the Aegolith and the rock, the reaction creates a chamber filled with various gases under high pressure and a 1-100 cm thick layer of pitch stone. How Aegolith got into the rock is unknown.

## Mining
Mining is extremely difficult due to the highly reactive properties. To get to the Aegolith, one must first open the gas-filled chamber in which the Aegolith, encased in pitch stone, is located. In smaller Aegolith deposits, the outermost rock layer of the chamber is indistinguishable from the surrounding rock. Only from a certain size can changes in the rock structure occur, shortly before one would "puncture" the chamber. However, these changes are barely visible in the often poorly lit, dirty, and dusty mine shafts, which is why Aegolith mining must be carried out with extreme caution. Nevertheless, larger Aegolith explosions still occur from time to time, which are usually fatal for many of the miners, such as the Edmora disaster.

After the Aegolith has been exposed, it is broken up with granite wood pickaxes and transported to daylight in wooden carts covered with straw. From there, the Aegolith is transported in secure containers to Whitehaven Keep, where it is shipped to the pitch stone refineries.
