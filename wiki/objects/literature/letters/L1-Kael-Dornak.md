# The Greyfast Nightwatch Letter

This letter was likely written during Kael's night watch duty while stationed at Greyfast Keep.

## Content

I do not know who I write to. Perhaps no one. Perhaps only to myself. I would rather see these words rot on the ground than return to my own eyes. Still, I must banish my thoughts onto this parchment.

There is another me. I have seen him, but never in full. He keeps to the edge of sight. A shadow with my face, my voice, my presence. He is patient. He waits. I know his sneer but I cannot touch it. When laughs without sound, I feel it in my chest like a nail driven there. He mocks every small breath I take. He is me, and he is not. I have tried to kill him with battle, with nights of training until I lay in my own sweat like a corpse. I have bled myself near to death in the hope that pain would burn him away. But he does not bleed. He does not tire. He sits and watches, smiling with my mouth.

I have hated the sight of water for what it shows me. My reflection is a trap where he waits. I strike the glass of mirrors. I split the face staring back. But the shadow always lives on. I cannot kill him, so every strike I land on others is meant for him.

I went to clerics, priests, monks. I thought they might speak some prayer, cast out this thing. But they turned their faces away. Some shrank back at my step, as though the air itself bent with doom when I entered. None would listen. None dared. Their eyes held the light of lives I never had. Their lips touched with love, their arms held by children, their homes warmed by laughter. I hated them for it. And when I struck them down, it was with hate, raw and burning. I thought it would feed me, but when their kin came weeping over their bodies, the hate only grew sharper. I cut them down too, thinking to drown it, thinking to quench the fire. But when they were gone, there was nothing. Only silence. No relief, no peace, only a stillness that pressed on me like earth upon a grave. In that stillness came his laughter, faint and cruel, without sound my own voice mocking me from the dark. 

I have done things I will not write. Terrible things. Whole villages whisper my name like a curse. So many fools, bright-eyed, calling themselves heroes, came to put me down. Not one asked who I was before. Not one cared. They came with banners and with faith, certain that their swords were the light that would cut me apart. Maybe they were right. Maybe I was the shadow they needed to slay. But they all fell. I shattered their blades, broke their shields, spilled their lives out onto the dirt. And every time I watched their eyes dim, I prayed the image would follow me into sleep and give me peace just for one night.

I cherish every wound from battle, whose pain keeps me awake through the night. I cling to it, resting in sleepless agony. When at last exhaustion drags me into sleep, oh how soothing the pain-riddled dreams and shallow sleep feels.

But when the dreams return, and it is their faces I see, my torment continues. The women I once chased, now smiling with warmth they never gave me. I pray to dream of blood, but I dream of tenderness. They don't love me in my dreams, but they treat me like a normal human being. I feel seen there. I long for that warmth, that connection, even if it is a lie. They are just there, meeting me at a market, helping out on the fields with me, or sharing dinner in a cozy home. He needs no romance in these dreams to see me suffer while I am awake. All he needs is the vast emptiness inside me. And he knows that.
