# Welcome to Bulwarks of the North (BotN)

Bulwarks of the North (BotN) is a collaborative fantasy world-building project created by [me](https://github.com/DrChristophFH) and open for anyone to contribute. 

I'd like to use these very first lines to welcome you to this project and to thank you for your time reading this! üòä

Let me give you a brief overview of the BotN universe:

## Overview

BotN is set in a rich and expansive high fantasy universe, that consists of [seven planes of existence](/wiki/030-Geography.md#the-seven-planes). Each of these planes is unique in its own way and has its own set of rules and inhabitants. The main "world" of BotN is the **Material Plane** called **Eides**. 

[Eides](/wiki/geography/Eides.md) is a vast world, full of magic, mystery, and adventure. Huge nations and empires fight for dominance. Vast landscapes stretch from the frozen north to the scorching deserts of the south. Mystical creatures roam the land, and ancient ruins hold secrets long forgotten.

The world of Eides is so vast and diverse that it would be impossible to cover everything in a single page. Most of the lore currently stems from what we call "The known Lands of Eides". Here we have the Arch-God Kingdom, the Free Lands, the Eastern Empire, and many more. Names that will soon become familiar to you as you dive deeper into the lore of BotN.

### A Kingdom of Kings

The **Arch-God Kingdom** is not only the most powerful nation in Eides but also the most influential. It comprises ten individual kingdoms, all under the collective rule of the **Arch-God King**. Non the less, each of these kingdoms has its own ruler, its own culture, and its own history. Some of these kingdoms are more closely befriended than others, so might even be considered rivals, but all of them are united under the banner of the Arch-God Kingdom.

There are many more nations and empires in Eides, but one of them appears to be the most prominent rival of the Arch-God Kingdom: the **Eastern Empire**. The Eastern Empire is a vast and powerful nation that has been at odds with the Arch-God Kingdom for centuries. Their rivalry has led to numerous wars and conflicts, shaping the history of Eides in profound ways.

### Did you say Bulwarks?

Yes, I did! **The Bulwarks of the North**, the namesake of this project, are three massive fortresses built to protect the Arch-God Kingdom from the dangers of the north. These fortresses are the main line of defense against the dark forces that lurk beyond the borders of the kingdom.

They tower over the Black Mountains, their walls facing the **Land of Abominations**. These northern lands used to be nothing but an icy wasteland, though that changed when Eides collided with two other planes of existence for a brief moment, Bargol, the dark plane and Anoxis, the blood plane. Though brief as it was, this **Dimension Convergence** had a lasting impact. It brought forth the corrupt and twisted creatures from Anoxis into the northern lands, turning it into the Land of Abominations.

### Where the Clouds turn Dark

The Eastern Empire is not the only threat to the Arch-God Kingdom. The **Dark Storms** are a recurring magical phenomenon that brings chaos and destruction to the lands of Eides. These storms produce powerful dark magic that can lay waste to entire cities and armies. 

In their quest to protect the kingdom, the Arch-God Kingdom has gone to great lengths trying to understand and combat these storms. The most notable of these efforts is the **Storm Watch**, a lone tower more northern than any human structure, built to observe and study the Dark Storms. Guarded by the **1st Storm Guardian Company**, an elite group of soldiers, the scholars of the Storm Watch work tirelessly to unlock the secrets of the storms and find a way to stop them.
