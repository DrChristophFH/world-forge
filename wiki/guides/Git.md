# Working with Git

If you're new to Git and GitHub and just want to contribute the next section is for you. Especially if you have never used Git or another version control system before. If you are already familiar with Git and GitHub, you can skip to the [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) section.

For all the others, follow me to the [✨Total Beginners Guide✨](/wiki/guides/Beginners.md) to get a step by step introduction to everything you need to know to contribute to the World Forge wiki!

## Commit Messages

When making changes, it's important to write clear and descriptive commit messages. For this reason, we follow a specific format for commit messages. Commit messages should be written, such that when appended to the sentence

```
If applied, this commit will...
```

it forms a complete thought. This format helps maintain clarity and consistency in our commit history, making it easier for others to understand the purpose of each change.

For example a message could look like this:

```
Add an article about the Grand War
```

This is ok, as it would form the following complete thought:

```
If applied, this commit will add an article about the Grand War.
```
