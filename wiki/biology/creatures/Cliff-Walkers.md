# Cliff Walkers

The Cliff Walkers are a mystical race of Eides. No one knows where they come from or where they live. These creatures can often only be observed from a distance in the mountains. Their silhouette resembles that of a human with goat legs, large horns, and glowing orange eyes.

## A Bad Omen

Myths say that Cliff Walkers are a sign that something terrible will soon happen. The fear of this fate goes so far for some that entire armies have retreated just because scouts spotted several Cliff Walkers in the distance.

Beyond the countless legends and tales told late at night in many a tavern, there are indeed well-documented cases, such as the Battle of Darenfeld. There, scouts on both sides (Fiendheim and Bivalon) saw several Cliff Walkers, yet they decided against retreating. What followed was a brutal battle from which ultimately neither side emerged as the winner. Although Bivalon won by a narrow margin, they lost so many soldiers that they could not further expand on this victory.

## Cultural Impact

The Cliff Walkers have become deeply ingrained in the superstitions and folklore of Eides. Their mere presence is enough to strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors. This has led to interesting dynamics in military strategy, where commanders must weigh the risks of potential supernatural doom against the more tangible threats of their enemies.

## Appearance and Behavior

While the Cliff Walkers are rarely seen up close, their distinctive appearance has been consistently reported across various sightings:

1. Human-like upper body
2. Goat-like legs, suggesting great agility in mountainous terrain
3. Large horns, possibly indicating some form of hierarchy or age among their kind
4. Glowing orange eyes, which are often the most noticeable feature in the darkness of their mountain habitats

Their behavior seems to be mostly observational. There are no recorded instances of Cliff Walkers directly interacting with other races, adding to their mystique and the fear they inspire.

## Scholarly Debate

The true nature of the Cliff Walkers remains a topic of heated debate among scholars of Eides. Some believe they are genuine harbingers of doom, possibly connected to the [Magic Weave](/wiki/magic/Magic-Weave.md) in some way. Others argue that they are simply a reclusive race whose appearances happen to coincide with unfortunate events. 

A few fringe theories even suggest that the Cliff Walkers might be remnants of the ancient Viators, though this is generally dismissed due to the stark physical differences.

Regardless of their true nature, the Cliff Walkers continue to be a source of mystery, fear, and fascination for the people of Eides.
