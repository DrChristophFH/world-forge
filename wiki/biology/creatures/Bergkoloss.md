# Mountain Behemoth

Mountain Behemoths are immense, living mountains. Their form and number of feet vary from specimen to specimen. They are the largest known living beings in [Eides](/wiki/geography/Eides.md).

## History

The Mountain Behemoths once roamed the plains of Eides many thousands of years before the Viators arrived. Ponderous and slow, they trudged through empty lands, feeding on the energy of the earth.

However, due to an unexplained cause, the Mountain Behemoths fell into an eternal sleep many hundreds of years before the arrival of the Viators, leaving their existence unknown for a long time. Many of them died in their sleep and became the mountains that now cover Eides. Only a very few of them still slumber alive in remote locations.

It wasn't until the dwarves, long before the Age of Bulwarks, encountered a Mountain Behemoth that was still alive, that their existence became known. From them come the only records of these creatures. Some fragments of these documents can still be found in the depths of the Library of Scholars.

## Physiology

The Mountain Behemoths are living mountains, with bodies primarily composed of stone and earth. Their size is truly staggering, with the smallest known specimen measuring over 2,000 feet tall, and the largest rumored to reach heights of over 10,000 feet.

Despite their rocky exterior, Mountain Behemoths have a complex internal structure. Dwarven excavations have revealed intricate networks of caverns and tunnels within their bodies, which seem to function like a circulatory system. Instead of blood, these passages carry molten rock and other stuff.

The number of "feet" a Mountain Behemoth possesses can range from four to twelve, each one a massive pillar of stone capable of crushing entire forests with a single step.

## Intelligence and Communication

While initially thought to be mindless giants, dwarven scholars have proposed that the Mountain Behemoths possess a form of intelligence far beyond human comprehension. They theorize that the creatures communicate through deep, subsonic vibrations that travel for miles through the earth. This could explain why they were often found in loosely associated groups despite their solitary nature.

## Impact on Eides

The Mountain Behemoths have had a profound impact on the geography and ecology of Eides:

1. Mountain Ranges: Many of the world's mountain ranges are believed to be the remains of deceased Mountain Behemoths.
2. Dwarven Cities: Some of the greatest dwarven cities are built within the bodies of dormant Mountain Behemoths, taking advantage of the natural cavern systems and abundant natural resources.

## Legends and Prophecies

Various cultures across Eides have legends about the Mountain Behemoths, although the occurrences of these creatures in legends are rare:

1. The Creation Myth: Some primitive tribes believe that the world was formed when a great Mountain Behemoth fell from the sky and shattered into countless pieces.
2. The Awakening: A common prophecy speaks of a day when the sleeping Mountain Behemoths will awaken, reshaping the world in their wake.
3. The Earth's Guardians: Certain druidic circles revere the Mountain Behemoths as ancient guardians of the planet, believing that they sleep to conserve their strength for a future cataclysm.

## Current Status

As of the present day, no living Mountain Behemoth has been officially documented for several centuries. However, rumors persist of remote, unexplored areas where the earth sometimes trembles with no apparent cause, leading some to believe that a few of these ancient beings might still exist in the most isolated corners of Eides.
