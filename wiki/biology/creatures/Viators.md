# The Viators

## Overview

The Viators were an ancient and enigmatic race that once inhabited Eides, playing a crucial role in shaping the world's magical foundations. However, knowledge of their existence has been lost to time, with only a handful of obscure scholars and hidden libraries retaining fragments of information about these mysterious beings.

## Origins and Nature

The Viators emerged in the primordial days of Eides, their very essence intertwined with the Magic Weave. Unlike the mortal races that would come later, the Viators possessed an innate understanding of magic that allowed them to shape reality in ways that seemed almost godlike to later civilizations.

### The Bright Era of Magic

During what later generations would call the Bright Era of Magic, the Viators reached the zenith of their civilization. They created marvels that defied comprehension, manipulating the Magic Weave to craft entire realms and bend the laws of nature to their will. It was during this time that they began to interact with the emerging mortal races of Eides.

### Teaching and Legacy

The Viators took it upon themselves to educate the various peoples of Eides in the use of the Magic Weave. However, their methods of weaving their will into the true essence of magic were intrinsically tied to their own nature, making it incredibly difficult for mortal minds to grasp. Even the brightest mortal scholars could only achieve minor feats compared to the Viators' abilities.

### Conflict and Departure

The limitations of mortal magic users led to frustration and resentment. A group of former scholars, led by Val Shovresk, developed new magical techniques that gave them access to the power of the Weave without requiring the Viators' level of wisdom. However, these methods irreversibly damaged the structure of the 

### Magic Weave.

This development led to a conflict known as the Battle of Val'ka√°run, where many Viators were killed. Realizing the danger of sharing their knowledge with beings unable to fully comprehend its implications, the surviving Viators made the decision to leave Eides.

### The Three Artifacts

Before their departure, the Viators left behind three artifacts of immense power, known simply as "The Three." These artifacts, more potent than any mortal magician's creations, were hidden and guarded by the Viators' most trusted scholars in three separate locations.

## Lost to History

In the present day, the term "Viator" is unknown to the common folk of Eides. The vast majority of civilizations have no recollection of this ancient race or their significant impact on the world's magical history. This loss of knowledge speaks to the vast gulf of time separating the age of the Viators from the present era.

### Obscure Scholarship

A very small number of scholars, working in isolation or as part of secretive organizations, still pursue knowledge about the Viators. These researchers piece together fragments of ancient texts, decipher cryptic inscriptions, and study anomalies in the Magic Weave to glean what little information they can about these forgotten beings.

### The Three

Along with the Viators themselves, knowledge of the powerful artifacts known as "The Three" has also faded into obscurity. These items, believed to be of immense magical power, are as much a mystery as their creators.

## The Keepers of Three

Among the few aware of the Viators and The Three is an ultra-secretive order of powerful wizards known as "The Keepers of Three." This organization has dedicated itself to protecting and guarding The Three from those who might seek to gain the artifacts and their power.

### Agimon Draach's Acquisition

In 477 BB, a figure named Agimon Draach managed to acquire The Three, a feat of legendary proportions. Draach took advantage of the ongoing war between the Arch-God Kingdom and the Eastern Empire, using the chaos and distraction of the conflict to obtain the artifacts while the world's attention was focused elsewhere. This ultimately led to the catastrophic dimensional convergence known as "Draach's Dimension Convergence." in 481 BB, one of the most significant events in the modern history of Eides.

## Theories and Speculations

Among the few scholars aware of the Viators, there are various theories about their nature and impact. Some believe that the Viators were responsible for creating all species originating from Eides, positioning them as progenitors of life on the world.

However, due to the scarcity of reliable information, many of these theories remain highly speculative and hotly debated in the small circles where such discussions can take place.

## Legacy

Despite being forgotten by most, the legacy of the Viators continues to influence the world of Eides in subtle ways. The scars left on the Magic Weave by ancient magical practices serve as a lasting, if unrecognized, reminder of their presence.

The search for knowledge about the Viators and The Three continues in the shadows, driven by those few who believe that understanding these ancient beings and their artifacts could unlock unprecedented magical potential or reveal crucial secrets about the nature of Eides itself.
