A Senate composed of the Individual of Time, Space, Intellect, and the Unknown.

This entity is an inconceivably wise being called the Community of the Individual. It has existed for eternity, observing and gathering knowledge. However, it does not intervene and almost never gives advice, only doing so when knowledge is in danger that it has not yet been able to acquire. Nothing but knowledge is of interest to the Community of the Individual.
