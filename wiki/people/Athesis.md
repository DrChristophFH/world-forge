# Athesis, Apophis' 3rd Bearer

## Biographical Overview

Born: 333 AB (Age of Bulwarks)
Status: Unknown
Race: Tri-dimensional Hybrid (Infernus, Anoxis, and Eides origins)

## Genesis and Early Years

### The Harbinger's Inception

In the hallowed halls of Sanctum Sortis, a citadel of divine knowledge and spiritual purity, an event of cosmic significance transpired unbeknownst to its guardians. Within the corporeal vessel of an unsuspecting Arch Monk, a being of immense and terrible power began to gestate. This entity, later known as Athesis, would become the 3rd Bearer of Apophis.

The Arch Monk, sensing the malevolent presence growing within him, was gripped by a paralyzing fear. In his misguided wisdom, he chose secrecy over disclosure, believing his devotion and sacrificial offerings would be sufficient to quell the darkness. Alas, his prayers echoed hollowly in the face of cosmic design.

For four grueling months, the Arch Monk's body served as an unwilling incubator, wracked by a constant, insidious poisoning that defied mortal understanding. The culmination of this otherworldly gestation was the birth of Apophis' 3rd Bearer, an event that left the Arch Monk in a state of unconsciousness for days, teetering on the precipice between life and oblivion.

### A Clandestine Upbringing

In the aftermath of this cosmic nativity, the Arch Monk, still clinging to the futile hope of containment, resolved to raise the child in utmost secrecy. Within the confines of his modest quarters in Sanctum Sortis, Athesis spent his early years, nurtured by the very being whose body had been violated to bring him into existence.

## The Blossoming of Power

### The Corruption Spreads

As Athesis grew, the corrupting influence of Anoxis began to flourish within him, a dark flower blooming in sacred soil. Unbeknownst to the Arch Monk, he became an unwitting puppet to the young Athesis, whose burgeoning powers of manipulation granted him unprecedented access to the hallowed knowledge contained within Sanctum Sortis' holy library.

### Enlightenment Through Ancient Texts

It was through a seminal work of metaphysical scholarship that Athesis first encountered references to his cosmic progenitor. "Non-World-Bound Native Beings in the Cosmic Vortex", an incomplete spiritual-scientific treatise penned by Arch Monk Bomephosius around 1203 BB, became the cornerstone of Athesis' self-discovery.

This unfinished work posited, and in some cases provided evidence for, the existence of various entities native to the cosmic vortex itself. Among these beings, one stood out in particular: Apophis, ominously referred to as the "World Eater." The incomplete nature of Bomephosius' work only added to its mystique, leaving much to interpretation and further investigation.

Athesis' discovery of this text marked a turning point in his existence. The young entity, who had known only the confines of Sanctum Sortis, suddenly found himself connected to a vast, cosmic legacy. The writings of Bomephosius opened a door to understanding that Athesis eagerly stepped through, consuming every scrap of information he could find on Apophis and the cosmic vortex.

### Realization of Cosmic Role

As Athesis delved deeper into the lore surrounding Apophis, he uncovered references to the Bearers of Apophis. With this revelation came the dawning realization of his own cosmic significance. The pieces of his fractured identity began to coalesce, forming a picture of terrible clarity.

Understanding himself as the 3rd Bearer of Apophis brought with it a sense of purpose and destiny that transcended the mortal realm. Athesis began to see his unique tri-dimensional heritage not as an aberration, but as a cosmic design, perfectly crafted for a role of unimaginable importance.

## The Cosmic Quest

### The Bearers' Burden

Recent discoveries in esoteric texts and whispered confessions of dying cultists have shed light on a cosmic quest of unfathomable importance. It is believed that Athesis, as the 3rd Bearer of Apophis, is part of a grand design spanning millennia, tasked with assembling a mystical artifact known as the cosmic key.

This cosmic key, comprised of five distinct pieces, is said to be instrumental in Apophis' inscrutable plans for reality itself. The full implications of the key's assembly remain a subject of fervent debate among the few scholars aware of its existence.

### Predecessors in Shadow

Records indicate the existence of two previous Bearers:
- 1st Bearer: Emerged circa 8150 BB
- 2nd Bearer: Appeared around 3800 BB

Due to the cataclysmic effects of [Wereth's Last Cleansing](/wiki/history/events/Wereths-Last-Cleansing.md), little is known about these predecessors or their success in their respective quests. This uncertainty adds a layer of complexity to Athesis' mission, as he may need to verify or complete the work of those who came before him.

### The Elusive Pieces

The pieces of the cosmic key present a unique challenge in their acquisition. Unlike traditional artifacts of power, these components are said to be mundane in appearance, indistinguishable from ordinary objects to all but the Bearer. This property allows them to remain hidden in plain sight, potentially for centuries.

Speculation runs rife about the possible locations of these pieces. Some scholars posit they could be anywhere: from a merchant's trinket box in a bustling market to the hoard of an ancient dragon. The search for these items is further complicated by their resistance to magical detection, making Athesis' task a test of cosmic intuition rather than arcane skill.

### The Keyhole of Donnarndar

Perhaps the most intriguing element of this cosmic puzzle is the existence of a location known as the Keyhole. Hidden deep within the mountains of Donnarndar, the northern dwarven kingdom, this mystical site is said to be accessible only to the current Bearer of Apophis.

The Keyhole's presence in dwarven lands, apparently unknown to the dwarves themselves, raises profound questions about the nature of reality and perception in our world. Some theorists suggest the site might exist in a state of temporal or dimensional flux, revealing itself only when a Bearer actively seeks it.

It is within this enigmatic temple that Athesis must place his piece of the cosmic key, should he succeed in locating it. The ritual of placement remains a mystery, known only to Apophis and its Bearers.

### Athesis' Burden

As the 3rd Bearer, Athesis faces a monumental task. He must not only locate his assigned piece of the cosmic key but also potentially verify the success of his predecessors. The weight of millennia of preparation rests upon his shoulders, with the fate of reality itself possibly hanging in the balance.

The time pressure is immense, as lore suggests each Bearer has only their lifetime to complete their part of the quest. This urgency, combined with the vast scope of the search, paints a picture of Athesis as a figure driven by cosmic forces beyond mortal comprehension.
