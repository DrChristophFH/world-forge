# Bartholomew Slater

Lieutenant General Bartholomew Slater was the head of the Fortification Staff of the Fourth Engineer Corps of the Third Solvalon Army. In 17 BB (Before Bulwarks), he was responsible for the design of the first Bulwark, a pivotal moment in the defense of the Arch-God Kingdom against the Abominations.

## Early Career and the Northern Threat

Born in 41 BB in the outskirts of Solvalon, Bartholomew Slater showed an early aptitude for mathematics and engineering. He enrolled in the Royal Military Academy at the age of 16, where he quickly distinguished himself in the field of military engineering.

Slater's military career coincided with one of the most turbulent periods in the history of the Arch-God Kingdom. Following the catastrophic Dimensional Convergence in 173 BB, which brought the Abominations into Eides, the northern territories faced constant threats from these otherworldly monsters.

As a young officer, Slater likely participated in the campaigns to secure the northern borders. The military had been struggling for decades to contain the Abominations, with monsters frequently breaking through and causing havoc in southern towns and villages.

## The Bulwark Project

As the attacks from the Abominations intensified, the existing fortifications proved inadequate. Slater, now head of the Fortification Staff in the 4th Engineering Corps, took on the challenge of creating a more effective defense. 

In 17 BB, after months of collaboration with renowned architects, Slater presented his concept for the first Bulwark to the Arch-God Queen. His design was revolutionary, incorporating both advanced engineering principles and magical enhancements.

The Queen, impressed by Slater's work, commissioned not just one, but three great Bulwarks:

1. The Bulwark of Gods in the west
2. The Bulwark of Titans in the north
3. The Bulwark of Darkness in the east

## Legacy

Slater's Bulwarks proved to be the turning point in the war against the Abominations. They provided a nearly impenetrable defense line along the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md), significantly reducing the incursions into the kingdom's territories.

The construction of the Bulwarks was a monumental task that spanned over two centuries. While Slater didn't live to see the completion of the last Bulwark in 242 AB, his designs and principles guided the entire project.

Today, Bartholomew Slater is remembered as the "Architect of the Bulwarks." His innovative approach to fortification, combining military engineering with magical reinforcement, revolutionized the kingdom's defenses and saved countless lives.

## Personal Life

Despite the limited personal information available about Slater, his dedication to the defense of the realm is evident in his life's work. He spent most of his career in the northern territories, facing the constant threat of the Abominations.

Slater's ultimate fate is unknown, but his legacy lives on in the mighty Bulwarks that continue to stand guard over the Arch-God Kingdom.
