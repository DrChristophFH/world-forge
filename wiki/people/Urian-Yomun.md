# Urian Yomun

Urian Yomun, also known as Urian var Termenor, was the first Arch-God King of the Arch-God Kingdom of Man. He rose from humble beginnings as a minor lord to play a pivotal role in the unification of the fractured kingdoms around Dreoniell.


## Life

### Early Life

Urian Yomun was born into a minor noble family in the borderlands of Dreoniell. His early life was marked by the struggles of his family to maintain their lands and status amidst the political turmoil of the region. Urian was educated in the ways of nobility, but he also learned the harsh realities of life for the common people.

### Rise to Power

As a young lord, Urian faced numerous challenges, including poor harvests and increasing taxes imposed by the ruling Queen Valdris. 

During military service for the Queen, Urian saved a fellow Lord, Lord Tristan Katakouzenos, during a skirmish. This courageous act, which he was not yet aware of at the time, would later have a significant impact on his fate. A group of conspirators, close to the Queen and the center of power, had been gambling on Lord Tristan's life, hoping to eliminate him and his influence among the nobility. Urian's unintended interference prevented their success and hence put him in their line of fire.

Through a few insidious political maneuvers, the conspirators sought to discredit Urian and turn the Queen against him. They painted him as a dangerous rival, a potential usurper who threatened the stability of the realm. Urian found himself increasingly isolated, with former allies distancing themselves from him out of fear or self-preservation.

This peaked in his exile, where he was forced to flee Dreoniell and seek refuge among the outcasts and dispossessed nobles of the realm. It was during this time that he met Matthias, a radical cleric of the then still-emerging faith of the Monasterium var Imperi. Matthias quickly recognized Urian's potential and became his mentor, guiding him in both spiritual and political matters.

Unaware of the full extent of Matthias' influence, Urian began to adopt the cleric's ideals, which emphasized the importance of unity, but also dangerous concepts of power and control. Urian became the target of Matthias' radical personal cult, which sought to elevate him as a divine figure destined to unite the fractured kingdoms.

Thanks to Matthias' connections and far-reaching network, Urian was able to gather a following among the disillusioned and marginalized factions of society. This support base would prove crucial in his quest for power and legitimacy.

In coordination with Lord Tristan, who still held influence among the nobility, Urian and his followers eventually stormed the capital, leading to a confrontation with Queen Valdris and her loyalists, ending in the overthrow of the Queen.
