## Life

As the last Oath Guardian, Durward has been defending the Catacombs of Kings alone for several centuries against the creatures of the Deep Mountains. Once they were many, but all of his former comrades fell in battle to protect the holy and magical site to which they swore eternal loyalty.

The royal lineage that the Oath Guardians served thousands of years ago has been gone for hundreds of years, as have the creatures of the Deep Mountains. Only Durward and the Catacombs themselves remain from this section of history.

Forever obligated to protect the Catacombs, he will continue to guard them against all evil in the future, until he too is released from his duty through death in battle.
