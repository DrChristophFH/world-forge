# Ser Kael Dornak of Skelgard


**Kael Dornak** (dates of birth and death uncertain, often conjectured as c. 81 - 27 BB) was a knight of ill-fated renown, remembered not for deeds of honor but for the singular torment that defined his existence. Kael is regarded by most historians as a tragic exemplar of knightly failure, undone less by wounds of flesh than by the wounds of the heart and the phantoms of sleep.

## Early Life and Rise

<!-- Skelgard is the castle in which the house Grenval resides. It is located in an area named Holford in the lordship Agoiir in Fiendheim. Kael Dornak was knighted under their banner, though in the black mountains. -->

The details of Kael's birth are shrouded in obscurity. The *Annals of Skelgard* place his origin in the borderlands of Holford, naming him the son of a retainer of the house of Grenval in the lordship Agoiir in Fiendheim. [^1]

Whether noble or merely of yeoman stock, Kael received training in arms sufficient to earn notice during the Forelands Campaign. His elevation to knighthood is attributed to his service at the siege of [Lower Karr Keep](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Lower-Karr-Keep.md) (c. 54 BB), where military reports describe his "unyielding cruelty upon the walls".[^2]

Unlike many knights whose reputations were forged in acts of gallantry, Kael's rise was steeped in fear. Soldiers of his own host wrote of him as a man to whom bloodshed was as common as breath, one "untouched by horror, untroubled by betrayal".[^3] Yet these same witnesses remark upon a peculiar emptiness, a lack of the joy or fervor that often animated younger knights. His gaze, they claim, was fixed not upon victory but upon something unseen, always beyond his reach.

## The Torment of Dreams

It is generally agreed that Kael's true affliction lay not in waking life but in the realm of dreams. According to the disputed but oft-cited *Fragments of the Ashen Codex*, Kael was visited nightly by visions of women he had once pursued, each of whom had spurned him in his earlier years.[^4] In dreams they did not revile him, but appeared with tenderness, granting him the intimacy he had never known by day.

What might have been solace for another became torment for him. As Kael himself allegedly wrote in a lost letter preserved only in excerpt, "What others would name paradise I name prison. It mocks me with what cannot be".[^3] These nightly visions, far from comforting, sharpened the wound of rejection until it consumed him.

Wounded in battle and skirmishes countless times, Kael's body was said to be a tapestry of scars. One note, attributed to a healer in Veyrn, described his body as "unseen fleshy disfigurement".[^6] A fact that only deepened his sense of isolation.

## Descent and Wandering

In his quest to silence the dreams, Kael eventually abandoned all orthodox remedies. He sought no priestly blessing, nor the draughts of healers. Instead he turned to poisoners, necromancers, and the masters of corrupted courts. He is recorded at the Feast of Ironhall, where traitors plotted patricide at the king's table[^7], and on the charnel fields of Veyrn, where carrion birds outnumbered the living.[^8] None of these scenes of cruelty moved him, for they were lesser agonies than those he endured each night.

Later witnesses remark upon a change in his demeanor. In the final eight years of his life, no record has survived of him speaking a single word.[^9] He drifted through the brutal circles of the world like a leaf borne upon a river. From battlefield to battlefield, from guarding foul kings to killing for lords of shadowy renown, Kael surrendered his course to circumstance. It was as if the world itself carried him, while he bore within him only silence.

## Final Years and Disappearance

The end of Kael's life remains a matter of speculation. The *Vault of Whispers Manuscript* mentions a "[...] peculiar dark [...] soul of Selsgard" that perished within that accursed place, torn apart by voices not his own.[^10] Scholars debate whether this refers to Kael, arguing that "Selsgard" could be a translation error for "Skelgard" due to the incompatibility of Root Speech, the language *Vault of Whispers Manuscript* was written in, and the Common Language.

Other sources, such as the itinerant bard Sarn of Rhyvel, contend he yet wanders, unable to die, condemned to dream.[^11]
