# Ipso

## Older Than the Stone Itself

With a modest 897 years old, Ipso was the oldest known living scion of the Dwarves. This age, however, is not a coincidence. What few people know is that dwarves can live significantly longer than their average life expectancy of 200-300 years. Unlike his fellow dwarves, Ipso is one of the few dwarfs who lives far away from mines and forges and the harsh living conditions that come with them. By staying away from toxic mine fumes, the unspeakable heat in dwarf forges, constant physical strain, and the often more than questionable diet of dwarves, Ipso's life expectancy increased many times over. Just as humans would only survive the dwarven lifestyle for 20-30 years, but could live up to a hundred years with a healthy lifestyle, the same was true for dwarves.

## A Head Full of Confused Mine Shafts

However, his great age has one major disadvantage. Although the bodies of dwarves could live to be over 800 years old, their brains were not adapted to it. Over the millennia, they had adapted to the harsh environment of mine shafts and hard physical labor. For this reason, Ipso's mind often seems a little confused and off-track to most outsiders, although it is still fully functional.

## The Beard of the Ancestors

His most distinctive trademark is his beard, which he wore with pride like his fellow dwarves. However, where most dwarves keep it trimmed to a still wearable length so that they can still forge, fight, and mine ore, Ipso simply let it grow. If one were to ask him about the length of his beard, which is practically scattered all over his hut, he replied that the exact length at the last measurement was 46.5 meters. However, the answer to how long ago this measurement was varies greatly, and the Archmage Agowix estimated the length of the beard to be over 60 meters in his time.

## Cultural Significance

Ipso's existence challenges many assumptions about dwarven life and biology. His extreme longevity serves as a testament to the potential lifespan of dwarves when removed from their traditional, harsh living conditions. This raises interesting questions about dwarven culture and why they continue to live in ways that significantly shorten their lives.
