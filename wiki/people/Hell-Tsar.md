# The Hell Tsar

## Overview

The Hell Tsar, known in ancient texts as Arderal, was a being of immense power and malevolence whose very name once struck terror into the hearts of mortals across Eides. His origin remains shrouded in mystery, but his impact on the world's history is undeniable.

## The Apocalypse

In an era long past, approximately 43,500 years before the construction of the Bulwarks, the Hell Tsar unleashed his terrifying Hell Hordes upon the world of Eides. This cataclysmic event, remembered in lore as the Apocalypse, threatened to bring about the end of all creation. Eyewitness accounts from that time, preserved in ancient scrolls, described the Hell Hordes as a nightmarish army that would have made even the bravest warriors tremble in fear.

## Banishment

The tide of destruction seemed unstoppable until a group of courageous adventurers and mercenaries, blessed by the enigmatic Viators, devised a cunning plan. Through their combined efforts and sacrifices, they managed to banish the Hell Tsar to the dimension of Infernus around 43,000 years before the Bulwarks' construction. This realm, often mischaracterized in ancient texts as the infinite void of the Abyss, became the Hell Tsar's prison for millennia.

## Exile in Infernus

Though Infernus was the origin of his Hell Hordes, it was not the Hell Tsar's native realm. The scorching, infernal landscape was as much a torment to him as it was to the damned souls trapped there. In this harsh environment, the Hell Tsar's hatred for the Viators and the world that had rejected him grew with each passing moment.

Despite his circumstances, the Hell Tsar's ambition never waned. He ordered the construction of a massive fortress, Ardens Arcis, which became the seat of his power in Infernus. From this bastion, he continued to expand his influence and searched tirelessly for a means to break free from his exile.

## Return to Eides

After forty-three millennia of imprisonment, the Hell Tsar finally found a way to return to Eides in the year 412 AB. Seven hell gates opened in the desert of Baherech, allowing the Hell Tsar and his Hordes to pour forth into the world once more.

Upon his return, the Hell Tsar encountered the grand army of Levira, numbering some 700,000 soldiers. In a twist of fate, this force was not assembled to oppose him but was en route to join the Eastern Empire's war against the Arch-God Kingdom. Mistaking their presence for foreknowledge of his arrival, the Hell Tsar launched a devastating assault. The unprepared Leviran forces were annihilated within three days, marking a significant turning point in the ongoing conflict between the Eastern Empire and the Arch-God Kingdom.

## A Changed World

The Hell Tsar's triumphant return was tempered by the realization that the world he sought to conquer had changed dramatically during his absence. The kingdom he once knew had long since crumbled to dust, replaced by vast, unforgiving deserts. The Viators, the focus of his millennia-long vendetta, had vanished from Eides. The races of the world had evolved, and the very nature of magic had been altered, leaving the Weave scarred and unfamiliar.

Faced with this new reality, the Hell Tsar retreated through the hell gates, accompanied by a young officer named Kohyar, who had cleverly ingratiated himself to the demon lord. The Hell Tsar vowed to continue his campaign and search for the Viators, adapting his ancient ambitions to this strange new world.

## Internal Strife

The Hell Tsar's new direction was not universally accepted among his followers. The demon titan Baaloth dared to challenge his authority openly, a grave miscalculation that led to Baaloth's public execution. This act served to reinforce the Hell Tsar's supremacy over the Hell Hordes and quell any further dissent.

Baaloth's stone corpse, impaled by three large swords, also turned into stone, was left in Baherech. Standing more than 40 meters tall, it served as a grim reminder of the consequences of defying the Hell Tsar's will and his unyielding power.

As of the last confirmed reports, the Hell Tsar had withdrawn to Infernus, closing the hell gates behind him. His current activities and plans remain unknown, a source of great concern for the powers of Eides. The threat of his return looms over the world, a dark shadow from an ancient past that may yet shape the future of all realms.
