# Barquin Prudenci

## One Step Ahead

Before the First Dark Storm, Professor Barquin was nothing more than an ordinary scholar of meteorology. However, after the Second Dark Storm proved that the First Dark Storm was not an isolated incident, he pursued the theory that the storms could be predicted, despite their complete difference from any normal weather phenomena. He was one of the few serious scholars to do so. In the five years following the Second Dark Storm, he developed various theories and measurements that he wanted to carry out in the event of a third Dark Storm.

After some of his measurements during the [Third Dark Storm](/wiki/history/events/dark-storms/Third-Dark-Storm.md) showed promising results, he presented these to the highest scholars and grand scholars. Prompting him to be appointed the first Grand Scholar of Storm Studies and receiving the means to further advance his research. Perhaps the most famous building he had constructed for his research is the so-called [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md), the northernmost standing building of humankind.

## Death

Professor Prudenci did not live to see the completion of the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md) due to a tragic accident during the construction of that very building. Despite all the concerns expressed by his colleagues and others involved in the construction of the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md), he supervised the construction on site. During a severe rain storm, the professor disappeared without a trace from the camp, and all search missions remained unsuccessful. Regardless of the many rumors and speculations, the generally accepted theory is that the professor fell to his death during the storm.
