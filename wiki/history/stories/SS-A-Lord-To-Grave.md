# A Lord to Grave

The sky over Lightfall hung like a shroud of pitch, an unnatural darkness that had persisted for twenty-five long days. No rain fell from these ominous clouds, but jagged bolts of crimson lightning occasionally split the sky, followed by thunder that crackled with an eerie, high-pitched wail. In the distance, tendrils of what appeared to be black lightning slithered between the clouds, their touch promising nothing but corruption and decay.

At the edge of the once-verdant forest of Thalan, now a twisted mockery of its former glory, Lord Edwyn stood before the remnants of his people. Behind him, a small group of volunteers—the bravest souls in all of Lightfall—prepared for what they all knew would likely be their final mission. Their faces were grim, etched with the horrors they had witnessed over the past weeks of relentless assault from the forces of Anoxis.

Edwyn's weathered face bore the weight of countless sleepless nights and impossible decisions. His voice, once strong and commanding, now carried a rasp born of shouting orders over the din of battle. Yet as he addressed those who would remain behind, a fierce determination burned in his eyes.

"People of Thalan," he began, his words carrying to every ear despite the oppressive atmosphere, "for twenty-five days we have stood against the storm. We have lost friends, family, and much of the land we hold dear. But we have not lost hope."

He gestured to the corrupted forest behind him. 

"I and these brave few will venture into the heart of our beloved woods, seeking to strike at the very core of this corruption. To those of you who remain, I say this: our task may seem futile, but it is in the darkest of times that the light of hope shines brightest."

Edwyn's gaze swept over the crowd, meeting the eyes of young and old alike. 

"You are the seed of our future. Whether we succeed or fail, you must continue the fight. Tend to the wounded, protect the innocent, and keep alive the memory of what Thalan once was—and what it can be again."

His voice lowered, becoming intense and urgent. 

"These may be my final words to you, but not the final words of Thalan. With me, dies nothing. My family, my name, I am not Thalan. Thalan are you people, the eyes that currently look at me, and the swords that will fight with me. In the darkness, you may forget the face of your mother, the voice of your father and the laughter of your children."

Edwyn's hand clenched into a fist, his resolve unyielding. 

"But you will never forget the forest. The first time its leaves fell, the first time snow settled on its branches, the first time its rivers flowed again. This is Thalan."

Heads nodded in understanding, tears glistening in the eyes of those who knew the truth of his words. The weight of their shared history, their connection to the land, hung heavy in the air.

"Dig no grave for us," Edwyn continued, his voice carrying on the unnatural wind. "What you may find as our corpses will not be us anymore. Remember us as we were, and carry it with you and our children." 

He paused, then spoke the ritual words that had been passed down through generations of Thalan warriors: "May our blood nourish the roots of the forest."

The volunteers behind him, their faces set with grim determination, raised their swords in unison. In low, resolute voices, they responded with the traditional words: "And the leaves turn red in our legacy." 

As one, they performed the Thalan battle gesture routine with their swords—a series of precise, fluid movements that spoke of their heritage, their commitment, and their acceptance of what was to come. The metallic rasp of steel on steel filled the air, a sound that seemed to echo through the very fabric of the world.

With the ritual complete, Edwyn turned to his band of volunteers. No more words were needed. With a final, resolute nod to his wife, Lady Elara, who stood at the forefront of those remaining behind, Edwyn led his group towards the twisted trees.

Those left behind watched in somber silence as the small band of warriors approached the edge of the corrupted forest. The malevolent darkness seemed to reach out for them, tendrils of shadow curling around their feet. One by one, they stepped into the gloom. 

The watchers held their breath, straining to keep sight of their brave defenders for as long as possible. But all too quickly, the shadows swallowed them whole. The last glimpses of their shimmering swords vanished into the murk.
