# The Price of Protection

The old man's gnarled hands traced the names etched into the massive stone board, his fingers lingering on one in particular: Elowen. He turned to face the group of wide-eyed apprentices gathered before him, the harsh wind of the Black Mountains whipping at their cloaks.

"You want to know about the Bulwarks?"

Thorne's voice was gruff, weathered by years of shouting over the din of construction. 

"Then you need to know about her. About all of them."

He gestured to the thousands of names behind him, each a silent testimony to the price paid for the realm's protection.

The apprentices huddled closer, eager to hear the tale. Thorne's mind drifted back to that day, nearly five decades ago, when he first laid eyes on Elowen...

---

The wagon creaked and groaned as it crested the final hill, its bed packed with stonemasons from the southern kingdoms. Elowen sat with her back straight, ignoring the complaints of her fellow draftees. Her calloused hands clenched and unclenched, impatient for the feel of hammer and chisel.

As they reached the top, a collective gasp rippled through the wagon. Elowen's breath caught in her throat, her usually stern expression cracking with awe.

Before them stretched a scene of organized chaos on a scale beyond imagining. The Bulwark rose from the mountainside like a titan half-emerged from the earth. Scaffolding clung to its partially completed walls, swarming with workers that looked no bigger than ants from this distance. Cranes towered overhead, swinging massive blocks of stone through the air with ponderous grace.

"By the gods," someone whispered behind her. 

Elowen silently agreed. In all her years as a master stonemason, she'd never seen anything like this. The great cathedrals and palaces of her home kingdom seemed like children's toy blocks in comparison.

The wagon lurched forward, descending into the vast construction site. As they drew closer, the true scale of the project became even more apparent. The noise was overwhelming – a cacophony of hammering, shouting, and the deep groan of stone against stone.

The wagon rolled to a stop amidst a sea of tents and hastily constructed barracks. A harried-looking man with a clipboard directed them to deposit their belongings quickly.

"Move it!" he shouted. 

"Stow your things and assemble outside in five minutes!"

Elowen hefted her pack and strode towards the indicated barracks. The structure was poorly built, with gaps in the walls and a roof that looked like it would leak at the first sign of rain. Around her, fellow draftees grumbled and complained.

"This is what we're expected to live in?" one man whined.

Elowen said nothing, her face impassive as she claimed a bunk and stowed her meager possessions. She'd slept on bare ground before; this was luxury in comparison.

Outside, they were herded into formation. A tall, lean man with piercing eyes and an air of authority approached. This, Elowen guessed, must be one of the overseers.

"I am Castor," he announced, his voice carrying easily over the din of construction. 

"Overseer of this work group. You are here because the realm needs you. The Bulwark is more than just a wall; it is our shield against the horrors that lurk in the cursed lands beyond."

Castor paced before them, his gaze sweeping over the new arrivals. 

"Some of you may think you're skilled," he continued, a hint of derision in his tone. 

"Let me assure you, whatever paltry experience you have building garden walls or quaint village homes is nothing compared to the task before you."

Elowen's jaw tightened, but she remained silent, her eyes fixed ahead.

"You will be assigned to existing teams, each led by a foreman," Castor explained. 

"They will be your immediate supervisors. Work hard, follow orders, and you might survive long enough to see this Bulwark completed."

As Castor began calling out names and assignments, Elowen noticed a group of workers on their break nearby. They lounged against stacks of stone, watching the proceedings with amused expressions. Every time Castor assigned someone to a team led by someone named Maevis, the workers would burst into laughter.

Elowen frowned, a sense of unease growing in her stomach. What was so funny about this Maevis? She hoped she wouldn't be assigned to his team, but fate, it seemed, had other plans.

"Elowen," Castor called out, "you're with Maevis."

The workers erupted in laughter once more. Elowen's frown deepened as she stepped forward, along with three other new arrivals who had also been assigned to Maevis's team.

Castor pointed them towards a section of the construction site. 

"Maevis's team is working on the eastern face. Head over there and report to him."

As Elowen and her new teammates walked past the laughing workers, she caught snippets of their conversation.

"Poor bastards," one chuckled. "They've no idea what they're in for."

"Bet they don't last a week," another added.

Elowen's unease grew with each step. As they approached their assigned area, the reason for the laughter became painfully clear.

The section was in chaos. Workers milled about aimlessly, some halfheartedly chipping at stones while others argued over tools. And there, sitting on a boulder with his head hanging low, was a thin, elderly man. His eyes, milky white, stared sightlessly into the distance.

Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward. 

"Excuse me," she called out to the nearest worker. 

"We're new assignees. Where should we start?"

The worker shrugged. 

"Anywhere, I suppose. Just find a spot and start working."

Elowen's frustration mounted. This was no way to build a wall, let alone a Bulwark meant to protect the entire realm. She looked around, trying to spot someone who might be in charge.

"Who's the foreman here?" she asked the worker who had just shrugged her off.

The man jerked his thumb towards the elderly man with milky white eyes, sitting alone on a boulder. 

"Good luck getting anything out of him, though."

Elowen looked at the thin old man in disbelieve. Before she could decide whether to approach him, she noticed her fellow new arrivals starting to disperse.

"Where are you going?" she called out to them.

One of them shrugged. 

"To find something to do, I guess. No point standing around here."

Elowen watched helplessly as they wandered off in different directions, leaving her alone amidst the chaos. She took a deep breath, steeling herself. If no one was going to give her direction, she'd have to find her own.

Scanning the work area, she spotted a section of wall that looked particularly shoddy. 

"Might as well start there," she muttered to herself.

As she approached the wall, Elowen quickly realized she'd need specific tools to properly address the poor stonework. She made her way to a group of workers arguing over a pile of equipment.

"Excuse me," she interrupted their bickering. 

"I need a pointer, a toothed chisel, and a dummy. Can you tell me where I might find them?"

The workers exchanged glances before erupting into laughter. 

"A pointer? A toothed chisel?" one wheezed. 

"Lady, you're dreaming. We haven't seen tools like that in months."

Elowen's brow furrowed. 

"What do you mean?"

Another worker shrugged. 

"We make do with what we have. Which is this."

He held up a battered, all-purpose chisel.

"But why?" Elowen pressed. 

"How can you perform precise work without proper tools?"

The first worker snorted. 

"Oh, ask the foreman. He's supposed to request supplies. But old Maevis there?"

He nodded towards the blind man. 

"Hasn't put in a request for anything in ages. We've asked, believe me. It's like talking to a stone wall."

Elowen's gaze drifted back to Maevis, her frustration now mingled with confusion and a hint of pity. How had things deteriorated to this point? And how was anyone expected to build a structure to last the ages under these conditions?

She turned back to the workers. 

"So where do I get such a chisel?"

"You'll have to find one that's not in use. Oh, and not broken. Good luck with that."

Elowen nodded, her mind racing. This was more than just a disorganized work site; it was a systemic failure of leadership and resource management.

With determination, she approached Maevis. The elderly man's clouded eyes stared unseeing at the ground, his thin frame hunched over on the boulder.

"Foreman Maevis?" she called out, her voice firm but respectful.

To her surprise, Maevis lifted his head, turning slightly in her direction. Though his eyes couldn't focus on her, there was an alertness to his posture that hadn't been there before.

"I'm Elowen, newly assigned to your team," she continued, encouraged by his response. 

"I need to discuss the state of our tools and-"

"Ha! Trying to talk to old Maevis, are you?"

A burly worker passing by interrupted with a harsh laugh.

"Might as well try having a conversation with one of these rocks, girl. You'll get more sense out of it!"

Maevis's head slumped down again, his brief moment of engagement evaporating like morning dew under a harsh sun.

"Thank you for your input," she said coolly to the laughing worker, then turned back to Maevis. 

"As I said, the tools are..." she trailed off, realizing she had lost his attention. 

"I see," she muttered to herself.

With Maevis unresponsive once more, Elowen set off in search of tools. The work site was a maze of discarded equipment, half-finished stonework, and clustered groups of idle workers. After what felt like hours but was likely only thirty minutes, she finally stumbled upon a chisel and hammer.

The tools had seen better days. The chisel's blade was chipped, and the hammer's head was loose on its handle, threatening to fly off with each swing. Undeterred, Elowen found a quiet corner amidst the chaos and set to work. Using scraps of leather from discarded equipment piles, she fashioned a makeshift wedge for the hammer's head. For the chisel, she carefully ground the blade against a rough stone, restoring some semblance of an edge.

As she repaired her tools, Elowen's mind raced. The disarray around her wasn't just poor management; it was a threat to the very purpose of the Bulwark. How could they hope to build a structure to withstand the test of time when they couldn't even maintain their basic tools?

With her implements as repaired as possible, Elowen stood, stretching muscles already sore from the long journey. She scanned the work site, locating the section of wall she'd noticed earlier.

"Right," she muttered, hefting her newly repaired hammer. 

"Let's see what we can do to fix this mess."

Approaching the wall, she noticed other workers glancing her way, some with curiosity, others with thinly veiled amusement. Elowen paid them no mind, focusing on the task at hand.

With practiced movements, she began chipping away at the poorly laid stones, her repaired chisel biting into the mortar with surprising effectiveness. Each strike of her hammer sent a satisfying ring through the air, a stark contrast to the aimless noise that had dominated the site before.

As she worked, Elowen's thoughts returned to Maevis and the sorry state of the work group. There had to be more to this story, she mused. No one becomes a foreman on a project of this magnitude without skill and experience. What had happened to reduce him to the shell of a man she'd encountered?

Elowen resolved to find out. But for now, she had a wall to fix. One stone at a time, she would bring order to this chaos. And perhaps, in doing so, she might just uncover the key to revitalizing not just the wall, but the entire work group.

With renewed determination, Elowen continued her task, the rhythmic sound of her hammer echoing across the construction site, a lone melody of purpose in a symphony of disorder.

It took all her expertise to make the wall look as it was supposed to. Carefully, she chiseled away the old mortar, straightened the stones, and carved space for new ones to fill the gaps. She worked tirelessly, melting into the rhythm of her craft. Numbers, measurements, and angles ran through her head as she labored.

After hours of work, she finally stepped back to survey her progress. Only then did she realize that what had felt like the whole wall was only a small section of it. The structure was massive, and she had barely made a dent in it. Taking a deep breath, she steeled herself for the long road ahead. It was a start, she reminded herself. And one had to admit, the section she had worked on looked sturdy and well-crafted.

"Well done," a voice said behind her. 

Elowen turned to see a bearded man approaching. 

"Now, if you keep this pace up, you'll finish the wall that's already there in a few months."

He burst into laughter.

Elowen's eyes narrowed.

"And who might you be?" she asked, her tone cool. 

"The local jester surely has to be more entertaining."

She turned her back on the stranger, ignoring his stupid grin.

The bearded man's grin faltered slightly at Elowen's dismissal, but he pressed on, undeterred.

"The name's Thorne, girl. Foreman Thorne. And you'd do well to show some respect."

Elowen turned back, her eyebrow raised.

"Respect is earned, Foreman Thorne. I've yet to see anything worthy of it here."

Thorne's face reddened.

"Big words from someone who's been here less than a day. You think you can waltz in here and impress someone with your fancy stonework?"

He gestured dismissively at her completed section.

"This isn't some village project. This is the Bulwark of Titans, girl. It'll take more than pretty masonry to make a difference here."

"And what exactly are you doing to make that difference, Foreman?"

Elowen shot back, her voice level but her eyes challenging. Thorne opened his mouth, then closed it again. He hadn't expected such pushback.

"What do you think who built the ground you're standing on?"

Thorne gladly accepted her challenging gaze. A barely noticeable head shake escaped Elowen when she realized that she just gave him the opening he was looking for.

"Who do you think built the western counterforts?"

Thorne's voice was rising, his eyes gleaming with pride.

"Come on, take a guess? No? I'll tell you. It was my team."

She could see the smug satisfaction in his eyes. Elowen's jaw clenched, but she held her tongue.

"You know what your marvelous team did in the same time? Shift a pile of wood from one place to another and call it barracks."

Thorne's voice was dripping with disdain and superiority. He saw the anger in Elowen's eyes and reveled in it.

"Exactly, if it rains on your head tonight, you'll know who to thank."

Elowen's fists clenched at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. She wanted to lash out, to put this arrogant scumbag in his place. But she knew that would only play into his hands. Instead, she forced herself to take a deep breath, to calm the storm raging inside her.

"Thank you for the information, Foreman Thorne," she said through gritted teeth.

"I'll keep that in mind."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, her jaw set in a tight line. Thorne watched her go, a smug smile playing on his lips. He'd gotten under her skin, and he knew it.

Elowen hadn't eaten since morning, a fact she was reminded when her stomach began a loud song of protest as she descended the construction site. The sun was dipping low on the horizon, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds. It was time to find some food.

Elowen approached a group of workers who were packing up their tools for the day. "Excuse me," she called out, "could you tell me where meals are served?"

One of the workers, a weather-beaten woman with kind eyes, pointed towards a large tent in the distance. "Head over there," she said. "They are serving. Better hurry if you want to beat the rush."

Thanking her, Elowen made her way to the tent. As she drew closer, savory aromas wafted towards her, making her mouth water. She joined the growing line of workers, all of them looking as tired and hungry as she felt.

When it was finally her turn, Elowen's eyes widened in surprise. The plate handed to her was piled high with a variety of foods that looked far better than she had expected. There was a generous portion of roasted meat, seasoned to perfection, accompanied by an array of colorful, well-cooked vegetables. The bread looked freshly baked, and there was even a small dessert.

Finding a seat at one of the long tables, Elowen dug in, savoring each bite. The food was delicious - easily rivaling the fare served at some of the finest inns she'd visited back home. As she ate, she couldn't help but overhear the conversations around her.

"Cook's outdone himself again," one worker mumbled through a mouthful of food.

"Aye," another agreed. "Say what you will about this place, but you can't fault the grub."

Elowen's brow furrowed as she considered this unexpected luxury. The quality and variety of the meal must cost a fortune to serve every day, especially considering the number of workers at the site. It seemed at odds with the decrepit state of some parts of the actual construction - the very reason they were all here in the first place.

As she finished her meal, Elowen's mind was buzzing with questions. The quality of the food and the efficiency of some teams, like Thorne's, stood in stark contrast to the disorganized mess she'd witnessed in Maevis's section. How could such disparity exist within the same project? More puzzling still, why hadn't anyone addressed these glaring issues?

The contradiction nagged at her as she cleared her plate. It seemed inconceivable that those in charge would allow such inefficiency to persist, especially on a project of this magnitude. The Bulwark was meant to be their shield against the horrors beyond, yet parts of it languished in a state of neglect and mismanagement.

With a sigh, Elowen rose from the table. The day's labor and these perplexing thoughts had left her exhausted. She made her way back to the barracks, her muscles aching with each step.

The wooden structure loomed before her, a testament to the very inefficiency she'd been pondering. Thorne's words echoed in her mind as she pushed open the creaking door. The interior was dim and drafty, with narrow cots lined up in rows.

Finding her assigned bunk, Elowen sank onto the thin mattress. She could hear the soft snores and mumbles of her fellow workers, some already deep in sleep after their long day.

As she lay there, staring at the rough-hewn beams above, Elowen's mind continued to churn. There had to be a reason for the stark differences she'd observed. Was it simply a matter of competent leadership versus incompetent? Or was there something else at play?

These questions swirled in her mind, but exhaustion soon overtook her curiosity. Her eyelids grew heavy, and before long, Elowen drifted off into a fitful sleep, her dreams filled with unfinished walls and the echoing sound of Thorne's laughter.

## Chapter 2

The next few days blurred together in a haze of backbreaking labor and mounting frustration for Elowen. Each morning, she'd wake with renewed determination, only to have it chipped away, bit by bit, as the day wore on.

Her first task was always to survey the previous day's work, and without fail, her heart would sink. Somehow, overnight, it seemed as if she'd made even less progress than she'd thought. Stones she'd carefully placed were askew, mortar she'd meticulously applied was crumbling. It was as if some malevolent force was undoing her work while she slept.

Doing everything on her own was a nightmare. Every time she needed assistance, she was met with indifference or outright refusal.

"Hey, can someone help me with the crane? I need to lift these stones to the upper level," Elowen called out one morning.

A group of workers lounging nearby barely glanced her way. 

"Not our job," one muttered, returning to his conversation.

Gritting her teeth, Elowen resigned herself to another day of extra steps. She loaded the crane herself, the muscles in her arms screaming in protest. Then came the arduous task of directing the mules to draw the cables, inching the heavy load upwards.

"Whoa there," she called, patting a mule's flank as it shied away from its task. 

"Easy now. We're in this together, you and I."

Once the stones were lifted, she had to scramble up the scaffolding, her legs burning from the countless trips up and down. At the top, she'd unload the crane, piece by painstaking piece.

One afternoon, Elowen came across a row of stones that made her blood boil. What had once been perfectly usable blocks were now a mess of jagged edges and uneven surfaces, as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to them in a fit of rage.

"Who did this?" she demanded, gesturing at the ruined stones. 

A few workers shrugged noncommittally.

"Needed some smaller pieces," one finally offered. 

"Figured these would do."

Elowen's jaw clenched. 

"There's a pile of scrap stone not fifty paces from here," she said, her voice tight with controlled anger. 

"You've just ruined an entire day's work for the sake of a few chips."

The worker shrugged again, clearly unconcerned. Elowen turned away, fighting the urge to scream. Now she'd have to spend hours reshaping these massacred stones, setting her back even further.

The lack of foresight and planning was everywhere. One day, Elowen spent hours carefully measuring and cutting stones for a specific section, only to find that the support structure beneath hadn't been properly reinforced.

"We can't place these until that's fixed," she explained to a group of workers. 

"It won't hold the weight."

"Not our problem," came the all-too-familiar response. 

"We just place the stones where we're told."

Elowen found herself having to backtrack, reinforcing the lower levels before she could even think about continuing upwards. It was like trying to build a house of cards in a windstorm.

The scaffolding was another constant source of frustration. Poorly constructed and haphazardly maintained, it swayed alarmingly even in light breezes. Elowen lost count of the times she had to stop her work to repair or rebuild sections of scaffolding, just to ensure she wouldn't plummet to her death while working.

Over the days she became quite skilled at it, but the better she got, the more her anger grew. She was a stonemason, not a carpenter. Her time and energy should have been spent on the wall, not on fixing someone else's mistakes.

"This is insane," she muttered one day, tightening a loose joint on a particularly rickety platform. 

"How has no one fallen yet?"

A passing worker overheard her. 

"Oh, people fall all the time," he said casually. 

"After a few times you get used to it."

Elowen stared at him, aghast. The casual disregard for safety was yet another symptom of the deep-rooted problems plaguing the project.

Despite the endless setbacks, Elowen pushed on. She worked through meals, started before dawn, and finished long after dusk. Her hands became a map of cuts and calluses, her back a constant ache. But still, she persevered.

Yet for all her efforts, the progress seemed negligible. The wall stretched endlessly before her, a monumental task that seemed to grow larger with each passing day. For every stone she placed, it felt like two more appeared, needing attention.

As she collapsed into her bunk each night, exhausted beyond measure, Elowen couldn't help but wonder: How long could she keep this up? And more importantly, how could she hope to make a real difference in this sea of chaos and indifference?

The answers eluded her, lost in the fog of fatigue. But still, each morning, she rose, ready to face another day of challenges. For the Bulwark had to be built, and if no one else would do it right, then by the gods, she would as long as she could hold her hammer.

## Chapter 3

The sun had barely crested the horizon when Elowen began her work, her muscles already protesting from the previous days' exertions. She was attempting to maneuver a particularly stubborn stone into place, her feet precariously balanced on the scaffolding, when she heard voices approaching.

A group of workers she didn't recognize was passing by, likely heading to another section of the Bulwark. Elowen paid them little mind, too focused on her task to care about the comings and goings of others.

"Need a hand with that?" 

The unexpected offer nearly made Elowen lose her balance. She turned to see a woman with bright eyes and a kind smile looking up at her. The woman was part of the passing group but had stopped, her gaze fixed on Elowen's struggle.

"I... yes, actually," Elowen admitted, surprise evident in her voice. 

It was the first time anyone had offered help without being asked—and usually ignored—first. The woman climbed up the scaffolding with practiced ease. 

"I'm Lyra," she said, positioning herself on the other side of the stone.

"On three?"

Together, they lifted the stone, guiding it perfectly into place. The task that had been giving Elowen fits for the better part of an hour was completed in moments.

"Thank you," Elowen said, wiping sweat from her brow. 

"I'm Elowen."

Lyra nodded, a warm smile on her face. 

"Nice to meet you, Elowen. Keep up the good work!"

And with that, she descended the scaffolding and rejoined her group, leaving as quickly as she had arrived. Elowen watched her go, a mix of gratitude and wonder washing over her. It was such a small gesture, but after days of struggling alone, it felt monumental.

The encounter with Lyra seemed to infuse Elowen with new energy. The rest of her day flew by in a flurry of productivity. Stones that had been giving her trouble suddenly seemed to fit perfectly. The aches in her muscles faded to a dull background noise as she worked with renewed vigor.

As the sun began to set, Elowen stepped back to survey her progress. For the first time since she'd arrived, she felt a genuine sense of accomplishment. The section of wall she'd been working on had grown significantly, each stone laid with care and precision.

With a satisfied nod, Elowen made her way to the dining tent. As she entered, her eyes scanned the crowded space, hoping to spot a familiar face. To her delight, she saw Lyra sitting at a table near the back, enjoying her meal. Gathering her courage, Elowen approached. 

"Mind if I join you?"

Lyra looked up, recognition dawning in her eyes. 

"Elowen, right? Please, sit!"

As Elowen settled into her seat, she couldn't help but feel a bit nervous. It had been so long since she'd had a friendly interaction here.

"I wanted to thank you again for your help earlier," she began.

"It... it meant a lot."

Lyra waved off the thanks with a smile.

"It was nothing. We're all in this together, aren't we? Or at least, we should be."

There was something in Lyra's tone that piqued Elowen's curiosity.

"You've been here a while?" she asked.

Lyra nodded.

"Two years now. I've seen a lot of changes, not all of them for the better."

Elowen leaned in, intrigued. 

"What do you mean?"

Lyra glanced around before lowering her voice.

"Let's just say that not all teams are created equal. Some of us still remember why we're here, why the Bulwark is so important. Others... well, they've lost sight of the bigger picture."

As they continued to talk, Elowen found herself hanging on Lyra's every word. Here, at last, was someone who seemed to understand the frustrations she'd been facing, someone who shared her dedication to the project.

Their conversation flowed easily, touching on their experiences at the Bulwark, their homes, and their hopes for the future. Before Elowen knew it, the dining tent had nearly emptied, the lateness of the hour catching her by surprise.

"I should get some rest," Elowen said reluctantly, not wanting the conversation to end.

"Early start tomorrow."

Lyra nodded in understanding. 

"It was good talking with you, Elowen. Don't be a stranger, alright?"

As Elowen made her way back to her barracks, she felt lighter than she had in days. The crushing loneliness that had been her constant companion since arriving at the Bulwark had eased. She had found an ally, perhaps even a friend, in Lyra.

Settling into her bunk, Elowen allowed herself a small smile. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, she knew, but for the first time since she'd arrived, she felt ready to face them. With Lyra's words echoing in her mind, Elowen drifted off into a peaceful sleep, eager for what the new day might bring.

She woke with the dawn, her body instinctively ready for another day of grueling work. It took her a moment to remember that today was different - it was her team's day off. A rare opportunity to rest, but Elowen had other plans.

After a quick breakfast, she set out to find Lyra's team. Her curiosity about their work, sparked by their conversation the previous night, drove her forward. As she walked, Elowen took in the enormity of the Bulwark project with fresh eyes.

The construction site was a labyrinth of activity, each section a piece of a grand puzzle she was only beginning to understand. She passed by teams working on various aspects of the wall - some laying foundations, others erecting scaffolding, and occasionally in special sections even small groups carving intricate designs into finished sections.

As she walked, the structure of the Bulwark began to make more sense to her. The section where Maevis's team - her team - was working came into clearer focus. It wasn't just a random part of the wall as she had initially thought. It was a crucial load-bearing inner wall, designed to support the outer shell construction facing south on the eastern part.

"No wonder the work is so demanding," Elowen muttered to herself, a new appreciation for the importance of their task dawning on her.

The realization made the constant setbacks and poor management even more frustrating. Such a critical component shouldn't be left in the hands of a disorganized and unmotivated team.

It took Elowen the better part of the morning to locate Lyra's team. They were stationed far to the east, where the Bulwark met the mountain. As she approached, her eyes widened in awe.

Rising before her was the beginnings of what could only be described as a fortress within a fortress. Massive stone blocks formed the foundation of what would become towering walls. Intricate scaffolding reached skyward, hinting at the impressive height the structure would eventually achieve.

"Elowen!" Lyra's voice cut through the din of construction. 

She waved from atop a partially built wall, a wide smile on her face. 

"Come on up!"

Elowen carefully made her way up the scaffolding, noting its sturdiness compared to what she was used to. When she reached Lyra, she was slightly out of breath, but exhilarated.

"What is all this?" Elowen asked, gesturing at the impressive construction around them.

Lyra's eyes shone with pride. 

"This, my friend, is the Eastern Ridge Keep. It's where the Bulwark connects to the mountain. Once it's complete, it'll be a fortress in its own right, capable of withstanding sieges and housing a significant defensive force."

As Lyra gave her a tour, Elowen was struck by the organization and efficiency of the team. Everyone seemed to know their role, working in harmony to bring the Keep to life. It was a stark contrast to the chaos she'd grown accustomed to in Maevis's section.

"How do you manage it all?"

Elowen asked, unable to keep the awe from her voice. Lyra shrugged, but there was a glimmer of pride in her eyes.

"A shared sense of purpose, I suppose. And of course, a good foreman helps. See down there?"

She pointed down to a tall, well built man, directing two workers in the placement of a massive stone block. He circled the stone, checking its alignment and making minute adjustments. Elowen watched, impressed by his attention to detail. Suddenly the man took a step forward, grabbing the stone himself and with a grunt, heaving it a few inches to the left and into place. He layed a hand on the shoulder of the worker next to him, pointing and explaining something. The worker nodded, and they both stepped back to admire their work.

"That's Bardhelm, our foreman," Lyra explained.

"He's been with the Bulwark since the beginning. He knows every stone, every block, every inch of this place. And he's not afraid to get his hands dirty."

"I can see that," Elowen said, her admiration growing.

As the day wore on, Elowen absorbed as much as she could, asking questions and even lending a hand where she could. The experience was enlightening, showing her what was possible when a team worked together effectively.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the construction site, Elowen prepared to head back to her own section. Her mind was buzzing with ideas and observations.

"Thank you for letting me observe today," Elowen said to Lyra as they said their goodbyes. 

"It's been... eye-opening."

Lyra squeezed her shoulder warmly.

"You're welcome anytime, Elowen. And listen, if you ever need any advice or just want to talk, you know where to find me."

With a final wave, Elowen made her way back to her barracks, yet she didn't get far before she was stopped by a now familiar voice.

"Elowen, you have a moment?"

It was Bardhelm, the foreman of Lyra's team, cleaning his hands with a rag as he approached.

"Of course," Elowen said, her curiosity piqued.

"I wanted to thank you for your help today. You have a good eye for stonework."

Elowen wanted to thank him for the compliment, but Bardhelm continued before she could speak.

"I know the work can get quite loud and my ears are not the best anymore, but I am not deaf yet. I heard you talking to Lyra and couldn't help but overhear your conversation. I wish I could offer you a place in my team, but Castor... well, he doesn't like others to interfere with his decisions would be an understatement."

A deep sigh escaped Bardhelm's lips.

"Don't let some dull tools break your marble spirit. In the end, nobodies name will be written on the stones we lay. Just let it pass and do your best."

Elowen nodded, grateful for the advice. With a tight-lipped nod, Bardhelm turned and walked away, leaving Elowen to ponder his words. The contrast between Lyra's team and her own was stark, almost painful to acknowledge.

The next morning, Elowen's body protested as she rose from her bunk. The previous day's exertions, though not her usual labor, had taken their toll. Every muscle ached, reminding her that a day of 'rest' at the Bulwark should really consist of rest.

As she made her way to the work site, Elowen gritted her teeth against the discomfort. She wouldn't show weakness, not now. There was too much to be done, too much she wanted to change.

Bardhelm's words echoed in her mind: "Don't let some dull tools break your marble spirit." She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the day ahead. She could handle this. She had to.

Today, Elowen had a plan. Instead of focusing solely on her own tasks or fruitlessly asking for help, she would try something different. It was time that she would help someone, not the other way around. But she knew that directly approaching someone and offering help might be met with suspicion or outright rejection.

She spent the first hour of the morning wandering the site, observing her fellow workers. She was looking for the right opportunity, the right person who might be receptive to her assistance.

Finally, she spotted him. A younger worker, probably new to the project, struggling with a particularly stubborn stone. He was trying to fit it into place, but it was clear he was having difficulty managing its weight and alignment simultaneously.

Elowen watched, biding her time. She wanted to step in at just the right moment, when the frustration was at its peak but before it turned to anger or despair.

As the worker let out a particularly colorful curse, Elowen made her move. Without a word, she stepped up beside him and placed her hands on the stone, helping to steady it.

The worker's head snapped up, his eyes narrowing. 

"What do you think you're doing?" he snapped. 

"You'll ruin all my work!"

Elowen kept her voice calm and her posture non-threatening. 

"Just thought you could use an extra pair of hands. Sometimes these stones have a mind of their own."

She adjusted her grip slightly, taking some of the weight off the worker's arms. Almost involuntarily, he shifted to accommodate her help, and suddenly, the stone slid smoothly into place.

The worker blinked in surprise, looking from the perfectly placed stone to Elowen and back again. 

"That... that was easier than I expected," he admitted grudgingly.

Elowen nodded, careful not to appear too eager. 

"Sometimes it just takes a bit of teamwork. I'm Elowen, by the way."

"Aren," the worker replied, still eyeing her warily but with a hint of curiosity now. 

"You... you've done this before, haven't you?"

Elowen shrugged modestly. 

"I've laid a stone or two in my time. Mind if I stick around? Looks like you've got quite a section to finish here."

Aren hesitated for a moment, then nodded. 

"Alright. But don't get in my way."

As they worked together, Elowen was careful to follow Aren's lead. Even when she saw him making decisions that were inefficient or even counterproductive, she kept her mouth shut. She knew that building trust was more important right now than perfect stonework.

She handed him tools before he asked, anticipated where he would need support, and offered encouraging words when a task proved difficult. Slowly but surely, she could see Aren relaxing, becoming more comfortable with her presence.

By midday, they had fallen into a smooth rhythm. Aren was even starting to ask for her input on certain decisions. 

"What do you think?" he asked, gesturing to a particularly tricky corner they were approaching. 

"Should we use the larger stones here or stick with the medium ones?"

Elowen considered for a moment. She knew the larger stones would provide better support, but she also remembered how Aren had struggled with their weight earlier. 

"The medium ones might be easier to maneuver in that tight space," she suggested, letting him feel like he was still in control.

Aren nodded, seeming pleased with the advice. As they continued to work, Elowen could see the pride growing in his eyes. They were making good progress, far more than he would have on his own.

As the sun began to set, Aren stepped back to survey their work. A slow smile spread across his face. 

"We did good today," he said, a note of surprise in his voice.

Elowen nodded, careful not to overplay her hand. 

"We did. Teamwork makes a difference, doesn't it?"

Aren scratched his head, looking thoughtful. 

"Yeah, I suppose it does. You know, Elowen... if you're not busy tomorrow, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to work together again."

Elowen felt a spark of triumph in her chest, but kept her expression neutral. 

"I'd like that, Aren. See you tomorrow."

As she made her way back to the barracks that night, Elowen felt a glimmer of hope. It was a small step, but an important one. She had made a connection, shown the value of teamwork. 

Tomorrow, she would build on this foundation. And maybe, just maybe, she could start to bring some of the efficiency and purpose she had seen in Lyra's team to her own section of the Bulwark.

With a satisfied smile, Elowen closed her eyes, ready for whatever challenges the next day might bring.

Over the next few days, Elowen and Aren fell into a comfortable rhythm. Their teamwork improved steadily, with each day bringing new challenges that they tackled together. Elowen was careful to let Aren take the lead, subtly guiding him towards better techniques without making it obvious she was teaching him.

"Hey, Aren," she'd say casually, "what if we tried lifting from this angle? Might be easier on the back."

Or, "You know, I once saw someone use a lever to move a stone like this. Want to give it a shot?"

Aren, for his part, was an eager learner, even if he didn't realize he was being taught. His confidence grew with each successful task, and soon, their section of the wall was progressing faster than any other in Maevis's group.

However, their success didn't go unnoticed. As Elowen and Aren's section of the wall grew steadily higher and more refined, whispers began to circulate among the other workers.

"Look at them go," one worker muttered, eyeing Elowen and Aren's progress with a mix of admiration and resentment. 

"Guess some of us are too good to work with the rest now."

"Yeah," another chimed in, "and have you seen the way Aren's handling those stones now? Where'd he learn that trick?"

The atmosphere in the group began to shift. Where once there had been mere apathy, now there was active discontent. Workers who had previously been content to do the bare minimum now watched Elowen and Aren with narrowed eyes, their own inadequacies thrown into sharp relief by the duo's efficiency.

One morning, Elowen arrived at the work site to find Aren already there, frowning at their wall section.

"Something wrong?" she asked, noting the frustration in his stance.

Aren gestured at the wall. 

"Some of the stones we placed yesterday... they're loose. I could've sworn we set them properly."

Elowen examined the wall closely. Indeed, several stones had been shifted, their careful placement disrupted. This wasn't the result of natural settling or poor workmanship. This was deliberate.

"Aren," she said slowly, "I think someone might have tampered with our work."

Aren's eyes widened, then narrowed. "But why would anyone do that?"

Elowen sighed, realizing she needed to tread carefully. 

"Sometimes, when people see others succeeding, it can make them... uncomfortable. Especially if they're not doing as well themselves."

Understanding dawned on Aren's face, quickly followed by anger. 

"So they're sabotaging us because we're doing a good job? That's... that's..."

"Frustrating," Elowen finished for him, placing a calming hand on his arm. 

"But getting angry won't help. We'll just have to work harder, be more vigilant."

As the days passed, the sabotage continued. Tools would go missing, only to reappear in inconvenient places. Carefully measured stones would be subtly shifted overnight. Once, a entire section of scaffolding was found dismantled in the morning.

Through it all, Elowen maintained her composure, using each setback as an opportunity to teach Aren about problem-solving and perseverance. She was careful never to accuse anyone directly, always framing the issues as challenges to be overcome rather than attacks to be avenged.

The tension in the group continued to build. Workers who had once been indifferent now actively avoided Elowen and Aren. Snide comments and hostile glares became commonplace.

One evening, as they were finishing up for the day, Aren turned to Elowen, his voice low. 

"Why are we still doing this? Why bother when everyone's against us?"

Elowen paused in her work, considering her words carefully. 

"Because what we're doing matters, Aren. This wall, this Bulwark... it's not a a vanity project. The people at home, my family, your family... they're counting on us to keep them safe."

Aren nodded slowly, a new determination settling over his features. 

"You're right. Let them try to stop us. We'll just keep building."

As they parted ways for the night, Elowen felt a mix of pride and concern. She and Aren had forged a strong partnership, one that was producing real results. But the cost had been high. The rest of the group was more fractured than ever, united only in their resentment of the duo's success.

Elowen knew that something would have to give eventually. The situation couldn't continue as it was. But for now, all she could do was continue her work, hope that her example would eventually inspire rather than alienate, and brace herself for whatever challenges the next day might bring.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the Bulwark, Elowen found herself wandering towards Lyra's section. The weight of the day's frustrations bore heavily on her shoulders, and she desperately needed a friendly ear.

She found Lyra cleaning her tools, humming softly to herself. Upon seeing Elowen's approached, Lyra's face lit up with a warm smile. 

"Elowen! What brings you to our neck of the woods?"

Elowen's carefully maintained composure crumbled at the sight of her friend's welcoming expression. 

"Lyra, I... I don't know what to do anymore," she admitted, her voice thick with emotion.

Concern flickered across Lyra's face. She set aside her tools and gestured for Elowen to sit beside her. 

"Tell me what's troubling you," she said gently.

The words tumbled out of Elowen in a rush. She told Lyra about her efforts with Aren, how she had painstakingly shared her knowledge without bruising his ego, the progress they had made together. But then her voice grew bitter as she described the backlash from the rest of the group.

"I thought I was making things better," Elowen said, frustration evident in her voice. 

"But now the group is more divided than ever. There's sabotage, resentment... it's a mess, Lyra. And I'm starting to lose my temper. I just... I don't know what to do next."

Lyra listened intently, her kind eyes never leaving Elowen's face. When Elowen finished, Lyra was quiet for a moment, considering her words carefully.

"Elowen," she began, her voice soft but firm, "you've done remarkably well, all things considered. But there's something you need to understand." 

She paused, making sure she had Elowen's full attention. 

"As long as you're seen as equal to the others, they'll always view you as competition when there's no proper leadership."

Elowen's brow furrowed. 

"But what am I supposed to do? I can't just declare myself new foreman."

Lyra shook her head, a gentle smile on her lips. 

"No, you can't. But there might be another way." 

She leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a near whisper. 

"You need to crack Maevis."

"But he's... he's barely there most of the time. He isn't leading the team, he's just... existing."

"That's the point," Lyra explained. 

"There's a story there. A reason he's in the state he's in now. If you can figure out his backstory, understand what happened to him, you might be able to reach him."

Elowen's mind raced with the implications. 

"And with his support..."

"You might be able to get the others on board as well," Lyra finished for her, nodding. 

"Maevis is still their foreman, even if he's not acting like it. If you can get through to him, help him remember his purpose, it could change something."

Elowen sat back, absorbing Lyra's words. It was a daunting task, to be sure. Maevis had been unresponsive, almost catatonic, since she'd arrived. But if there was a chance it could unite the group, improve their work...

"But how do I even start?" Elowen asked, feeling overwhelmed by the prospect.

Lyra placed a comforting hand on Elowen's shoulder. 

"It would be best if you could catch him when you two are alone. From what you've told me, the others are part of the problem."

Elowen nodded, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time in days. 

"Thank you, Lyra. I don't know what I'd do without your advice."

Lyra's smile widened. 

"That's what friends are for. And Elowen?" She waited until Elowen met her gaze. 

"Don't forget to take care of yourself too. You can't help others if you're burning out."

As Elowen made her way back to her barracks that night, her mind was abuzz with new possibilities. The task ahead was daunting, but at least now she had a direction, a goal to work towards.

## Chapter 4

For days, Elowen had been watching Maevis, looking for an opportunity to speak with him alone. Finally, her chance came late one evening as the work crews were dispersing. She saw Maevis shuffling towards an entrance to the inner corridors of the Bulwark and decided to follow him.

The passageways inside the Bulwark were a maze of stone and shadow, lit sporadically by guttering torches. Elowen followed Maevis at a distance, not wanting to startle him. Eventually, they reached a secluded corridor deep within the structure. Here, Elowen decided to make her move.

"Foreman Maevis," she called out softly. "May I speak with you?"

Maevis paused but didn't turn around. Taking this as permission, Elowen approached him.

"I... I wanted to talk to you about our team," she began hesitantly. "There are problems, serious ones. I've tried to help, to organize things better, but it's not working."

She went on to explain the issues she'd encountered: the lack of cooperation, the sabotage, the resentment. As she spoke, her frustration and worry poured out. But Maevis remained silent, his clouded eyes staring blankly ahead.

"Please," Elowen pleaded, her voice echoing in the stone corridor. "We need leadership. The Bulwark needs proper guidance. Why won't you lead us?"

But Maevis didn't respond. Instead, he began to wander along the wall, his gnarled hands trailing along the rough stone surface. Elowen watched, her initial hope giving way to frustration.

"Are you even listening to me?" she demanded, her patience finally snapping. "Don't you care about what's happening to your team, to the Bulwark?"

Suddenly, Maevis stopped. He turned towards Elowen and, for the first time since she'd arrived at the Bulwark, he reached out to her. His weathered hand gently grasped hers. Elowen was so surprised that she didn't resist as he guided her hand to the wall, pressing her palm flat against the cool stone.

Then, Maevis spoke, his voice a low, gravelly whisper that sent a shiver down Elowen's spine.

"What do you feel?"

Elowen blinked, confused by the question. "Stone," she replied, uncertainty clear in her voice. "Obviously."

Maevis shook his head slowly.

"Granite, to be precise," Elowen elaborated, thinking perhaps he wanted more detail. "It's a fine-grained variety, ideal for..."

Again, Maevis shook his head. "Obviously you can see," he murmured. "But can you feel?"

Elowen's confusion deepened. She was about to ask what he meant when Maevis continued, his unseeing eyes somehow focused intently on the wall.

"I feel it clearly. A quarter chisel, dull on the right edge, taking off small pieces. Then the stone chips, too much force." His hand wandered to the right. "He tries again." Another slight movement. "Again it chips."

Elowen stared at him, astounded. She peered closely at the wall, and there, barely visible, were the marks exactly as Maevis had described them.

"He hasn't noticed the small inclusion," Maevis continued. "Had he adjusted his angle just slightly, it would have been perfect."

Elowen was speechless. She ran her fingers over the stone, feeling some subtle imperfections.

"You feel all that just from the stone?"

A sad smile flickered across Maevis's face. "Each stone is not just a block to be placed. You must listen to it, understand it, feel it."

Elowen ran a hand through her hair, exasperated. "But we can't build a wall on feelings and whispers! We need leadership, plans, proper tools..."

"Tools?" Maevis interrupted, a hint of passion in his voice. "The greatest tool is the hand guided by understanding. The keenest measure is the heart attuned to the rhythm of the stone. All else is mere distraction."

Elowen found herself struggling between her practical nature and the undeniable passion in the old man's voice. Part of her wanted to dismiss his ramblings as the delusions of a man who had spent too long in the sun. But another part, a part she didn't quite understand, was drawn to the mystical reverence with which he spoke of the stone.

"Maevis," she said finally, trying to keep her voice level, "I understand that you have a... unique perspective on stonework. But the others, they don't see things the way you do. They need clear instructions, tangible goals. How can we possibly make progress if our foreman speaks in riddles?"

"The others," Maevis repeated, his voice soft. "For them, stone is a tool. Shaped by force, by will. I tried to show them that all it took was to ask nicely for the shape they wanted. But they didn't listen."

He reached out, taking Elowen's hand in his weathered one. "You learned to command, and imposing your will upon the stone and upon your fellow workers. It takes strength, determination, and skill to do so."

He paused for a moment, his blind eyes wandering off as if into another time. "I... I never had that strength. I cannot teach, what has never been taught to me. I can only ask them to listen with me."

Elowen felt a sudden surge of empathy for the old man. His words, though still cryptic, revealed a vulnerability she hadn't expected. She took a deep breath, making a decision that surprised even herself.

"Then... teach me to listen," she said softly. "Show me what you mean. Maybe if I can understand, I can help the others understand too."

Maevis's face lit up with a smile that seemed to erase years from his weathered features. "You truly wish to learn?"

Elowen nodded, then remembering his blindness, said, "Yes, I do."

"Then come," Maevis said, his voice filled with a new energy. "Let us find a stone that wishes to speak."

They made their way to a secluded area of the construction site where large, uncut stones waited to be shaped. Maevis ran his hands over several before stopping at one that was nearly as tall as he was.

"This one," he murmured. "It has much to say."

Elowen watched in amazement as Maevis, despite his age and blindness, positioned himself perfectly in front of the stone. He placed his left hand on the stone's surface, closed his eyes, and stood motionless for several long moments.

Then, with a speed and precision that seemed impossible, he struck the stone with his hammer and chisel. Once, twice, three times in rapid succession. Large chunks fell away, and to Elowen's astonishment, a rough shape began to emerge.

Over the next hour, Maevis worked with an grace and efficiency Elowen had never seen before. His movements were minimal, each strike deliberate and perfectly placed. By the end, what had once been a formless block was now a beautifully shaped stone, ready to fit perfectly into the Bulwark.

"Now," Maevis said, turning to Elowen. "You try."

Elowen approached another stone, hammer and chisel in hand. She tried to mimic Maevis's actions, placing her hand on the stone and closing her eyes. But when she struck, the stone chipped awkwardly, nowhere near the clean breaks Maevis had achieved.

"Don't force it," Maevis advised gently. "Listen. Feel the stone's grain, its hidden faults. Let it guide your hand."

Hours passed as Elowen tried again and again. Frustration mounted as stone after stone ended up misshapen or broken. But Maevis remained patient, offering quiet guidance and encouragement.

It was well past midnight when something finally changed. As Elowen placed her hand on yet another stone, she felt... something. A subtle vibration, a sense of the stone's structure that she couldn't quite explain.

When she struck this time, the stone split cleanly, almost effortlessly. It wasn't perfect, not nearly as impressive as Maevis's work, but it was a start.

"I... I think I felt something," Elowen said, her voice filled with wonder.

Maevis smiled broadly. "The stone spoke, and you began to listen. This is only the beginning, Elowen. There is much more to learn."

As they made their way back to the barracks, exhausted but exhilarated, Elowen realized that her world had shifted. She didn't fully understand what had happened, or how she would explain it to the others. But she knew that she had taken the first step on a journey that would change not just how she built, but how she saw the very world around her.

The Bulwark, she realized, was more than just a wall. It was a testament to the profound connection between the builder and the built. And somehow, she would find a way to help others understand this too.

The following day, Elowen woke with a sense of purpose. She knew what she had to do. It wasn't enough for her alone to understand Maevis's gift; the entire team needed to witness it firsthand.

As the sun climbed higher in the sky, Elowen gathered the workers. She had spent the early morning hours preparing several large, rough-faced stones, positioning them in a semicircle in the center of their work area.

"Listen up, everyone," she called out, her voice carrying across the site. "I have a proposition for you all."

The workers gathered, curiosity and skepticism mingling on their faces.

"I'm offering a substantial sum of money," Elowen continued, holding up a pouch that clinked promisingly, "to whoever can straighten and smooth the face of these stones the fastest."

A murmur of excitement rippled through the crowd. In a world where every coin counted, the prospect of extra money was enticing.

"Well, what are we waiting for?" one worker called out. "Let's get to it!"

The workers scattered, each claiming a stone and readying their tools. Elowen watched as they set to work, noting with some satisfaction the passion and energy they brought to the task. It was a stark contrast to their usual lackluster efforts.

Chisels rang against stone, a cacophony of determined labor filling the air. Some workers made steady progress, their experience evident in their measured strikes. Others struggled, barely managing to chip away at the rough surface.

As the competition wore on, it became clear that Aren was in the lead. His hands moved with practiced efficiency, his strokes sure and strong. Finally, he stepped back from his stone, wiping sweat from his brow.

"Done!" he called out triumphantly.

The other workers stopped, some looking dejected, others angry at their failure. But before the mood could sour, Elowen spoke up.

"Well done, Aren," she said, her voice calm. "But not everyone has had their chance yet."

Confusion rippled through the group. "What do you mean?" someone called out. "We've all been working here!"

Elowen didn't respond immediately. Instead, she made her way through the crowd, approaching the solitary figure of Maevis, who sat quietly on a stone at the edge of the work area.

The workers watched in bewilderment as Elowen gently took Maevis's hand, pressing a chisel into it. "Come on, Maevis," she said softly. "It's time to show them."

A ripple of disbelief and amusement went through the crowd as Elowen led Maevis to the last remaining stone. It was larger than the others, its face even rougher and more uneven.

"You can't be serious," one worker scoffed. "The old man can barely see, let alone work stone!"

Elowen ignored the comments, positioning Maevis in front of the stone. "Whenever you're ready," she said, stepping back.

Maevis stood motionless for a long moment, his hand resting lightly on the stone's surface. The workers watched, some smirking, others merely curious.

Then, without warning, Maevis began to work.

His movements were unlike anything the workers had ever seen. Where they had hacked and chipped, Maevis's chisel danced across the stone's surface. Each strike was precise, deliberate, seemingly effortless. Large chunks of stone fell away, revealing a smoother surface beneath.

The smirks faded from the workers' faces, replaced by looks of astonishment. Even Aren, who had been so proud of his own work, watched with his mouth agape.

In less time than it had taken Aren to complete his stone, Maevis stepped back. The face of his stone wasn't just straight and smooth - it was perfect. Every angle was true, every line exact.

A hush fell over the gathering. Elowen stepped forward, running her hand over the stone's surface. "This," she said, her voice carrying in the silence, "this is what it means to truly understand stone."

She turned to face the group. "Maevis has been trying to teach us all along. We just weren't listening. But now, if you're willing to learn, he can show us how to build not just a wall, but a true Bulwark - one that will stand for ages."

The workers looked from Elowen to Maevis, then to the perfectly shaped stone. Doubt, amazement, and a newfound respect warred on their faces.

Aren was the first to step forward. "I... I'd like to learn," he said hesitantly. "If you're willing to teach us, Foreman Maevis."

One by one, the other workers nodded their agreement. The atmosphere had shifted, the earlier competitiveness replaced by a shared sense of wonder and possibility.

Maevis, who had remained silent throughout, finally spoke. His voice was soft, but it carried to every ear. "The stone speaks to all who are willing to listen. I will teach you, if you are ready to hear."

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the Bulwark, Elowen felt a surge of hope. It wouldn't be easy, she knew. Changing ingrained habits and perspectives never was. But for the first time since she'd arrived, she felt that they were on the right path.
