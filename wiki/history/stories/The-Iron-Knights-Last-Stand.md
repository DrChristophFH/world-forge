# The Iron Knights' Last Stand: The Defense of Iplas

In the waning days of Dutemt, 461 AB, a force of 500 Iron Knights marched south towards Iplas, capital of the lordship Ilethnias in Trivalon. The air was thick with tension, the Eastern Empire's advance into the Arch-God Kingdom a looming shadow over the land. The Iron Knights, alchemically enhanced warriors encased in arm-thick grey plate armor, moved with purpose and deadly grace.

Their commander, Warbearer Gawn, led the column. His face, like those of his comrades, remained hidden behind the expressionless visage of his helmet. The Iron Knights were more than mere soldiers; they were living weapons, forged in the crucible of grueling training and arcane enhancement. Each stood a head taller than the average man, their strength legendary even among the battle-hardened ranks of the Arch-God Kingdom's armies. Every step they took reverberated with the weight of their purpose, the iron-shod boots of the Iron Knights thundering in unison. Each of them a 400-pound juggernaut of destruction, capable of cleaving through entire ranks of enemy soldiers with a single swing of their massive swords.

As they approached the fortified city of Iplas, scouts brought word of the Eastern Empire's overwhelming numbers. Gawn called his captains to council, their helmed heads bowed in discussion as they pored over maps and strategic reports.

The Iron Knights set up their camp in the outskirts of the city, a field of grey tents. For several days, they stood vigilant, their presence a reassuring sight for the anxious citizens of Iplas.

On the fifth day, a messenger arrived from the commander of the Trivalon Army. The news was grim: Offlion, the capital of Trivalon itself, was under threat. The majority of the Iron Knights were ordered to march to its defense immediately.

Warbearer Gawn stood atop a small rise, his massive form silhouetted against the setting sun. He surveyed his troops, each a paragon of martial prowess, each sworn to the defense of the Arch-God Kingdom. With a heavy heart, he made his decision.

"Sentinel Raaf," Gawn's voice boomed across the camp. "You and nine of your Knights will remain here in Iplas."

A ripple of anticipation passed through the assembled Iron Knights, though their stoic demeanor betrayed no emotion. Sentinel Raaf stepped forward, his armor gleaming. "Warbearer," he said, his voice steady and resolute. "We await your command."

Gawn nodded solemnly. "To you and your chosen men, I grant the Order of Duty. You will stand as the bulwark against the tide, buying time for our forces to consolidate and for the civilians to evacuate."

A reverent silence fell over the camp as the significance of the moment settled upon them. The Order of Duty was the highest honor an Iron Knight could receive, a sacred trust to fight until the last breath in defense of the Arch-God Kingdom.

Without hesitation, nine Knights stepped forward and down on one knee to join Raaf. Their movements were precise, disciplined—a testament to their unwavering dedication to duty. No words were necessary; their actions spoke volumes of their willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Warbearer Gawn addressed the chosen ten, his voice carrying the weight of centuries of tradition. "Iron Knights, you have been granted the highest honor our order can bestow. You stand now in the footsteps of our predecessors, ready to etch your deeds into the annals of our brotherhood."

The Iron Knights stood at attention, their massive forms unmoving, unwavering in the face of their fate. They sought no glory from the common folk, no songs or legends to be sung in taverns. Their purpose was singular: to stand against the tide of the enemy, to hold the line with every fiber of their being.

"You carry the names of those who came before you," Gawn continued. "And in your actions, you will honor their memory and pave the way for those who will bear these names after you. Your brothers will remember your stand, and it is their respect alone that you carry with you into battle."

Sentinel Raaf spoke, his voice resonating within his helm. "We are honored, Warbearer. We will not falter."

As the rest of the Iron Knights prepared to march for Offlion, Gawn gave his final orders to Raaf. "Sentinel, as is our way, you will pray to the goddess of war for her blessing. Let your blades drink in her favor, that they might strike true in the coming storm."

Gawn handed Raaf a small vial of incense, a rare and precious substance.

"It shall be done, Warbearer," Raaf responded with a curt nod.

The camp bustled with activity as the main force prepared to depart. The chosen ten stood apart, already focused on the task ahead. No farewells were exchanged; such sentimentality had no place among the Iron Knights. They were weapons of war, honed to a razor's edge, and now they would fulfill their purpose.

As night fell and the majority of the Iron Knights thundered away towards Offlion, Raaf knelt alone in a dimly lit tent. In front of him stood a small altar, flickering candles casting dancing shadows on the walls. The incense burned, its fragrant smoke curling upwards in the still air. The ten swords of the Iron Knights lay before him, gleaming in the candlelight with dark anticipation. Bowing his head, Raaf began to pray, murmuring the ancient words of the Iron Knights' ritual in a low, rumbling voice repeatedly. 

Hours passed, the night deepening and then slowly giving way to the first hints of dawn. As the eastern sky began to lighten, painting the world in shades of grey and pale gold, ten titanic figures stood motionless before the gates of Iplas castle.

The Iron Knights formed an impenetrable line. Their blessed swords, each as tall as a man, were planted point-down before them. No word was spoken, no movement made. They were living statues, avatars of war awaiting the coming storm.

Behind the massive walls of the castle, hundreds of soldiers peered down at the scene below. These men, a mere fraction of the thousands of defenders still left in the city, watched the Iron Knights with a mixture of awe and trepidation. The contrast was stark—ten giants of steel and resolve standing against the tide that threatened to engulf them all.

In the distance, dust clouds rose on the horizon, heralding the approach of the Eastern Empire's vast army. The air grew thick with tension, the calm before the inevitable tempest of battle.

Sentinel Raaf stood at the center of the line, his posture betraying nothing of the night's vigil. To his left and right, his brothers in arms remained equally stoic, their expressionless helmets facing the coming threat. These were the chosen ten, granted the Order of Duty, prepared to sell their lives dearly in defense of Iplas.

As the sun climbed higher, glinting off their grey armor, the Iron Knights stood resolute. They were the bulwark against the darkness, the unyielding steel of the Arch-God Kingdom. In their stance was a promise—of duty, of sacrifice, of a last stand that would be remembered in the annals of their brotherhood for generations to come.

The horizon erupted in a sea of bodies as the Eastern Empire's forces poured through the surrounding city towards the castle gates. In that moment, nine of the Iron Knights surged forward, leaving Raaf standing alone. They moved like titans awakened from ancient slumber, each step a thunderclap, each movement an unstoppable force of nature.

The clash of steel on steel rang out as the Iron Knights met the front lines of the enemy. What followed could only be described as a meat grinder, a maelstrom of violence with the Iron Knights at its eye. Their massive swords cleaved through ranks of soldiers as if they were wheat before a scythe. Bodies flew through the air, tossed aside by the sheer force of their swings.

Arrows rained down from all directions, a deadly hail from both defenders on the walls and attackers in the streets. Yet against the Iron Knights, they might as well have been raindrops. The arm-thick plate armor deflected every shaft, the pings and clangs adding a percussive backdrop to the symphony of battle.

One Iron Knight, his armor already slick with the blood of his foes, grabbed an enemy soldier by the head and used him as a makeshift flail, sweeping aside a dozen men before discarding the broken body. Another brought his sword down with such force that it not only split his opponent in two but continued into the cobblestones, sending shards of stone flying like shrapnel.

The streets ran red, choked with the broken bodies of the Eastern Empire's soldiers. Yet still they came, wave after wave breaking against the iron bulwark of the Knights. Each Knight stood at the center of his own whirlwind of destruction, a vortex of flashing steel and spraying blood.

Amidst this chaos, Sentinel Raaf stood motionless at the gates, a statue of grey steel unmoved by the tide of battle. From his perspective, the reason for his immobility became clear. Before him stood a female figure, dressed in noble silk that rippled with unseen winds. Her presence was both terrible and beautiful, power radiating from her in palpable waves. The goddess of war herself had come to the battlefield.

Raaf's fury was almost tangible, his entire being straining against the goddess's hold. He could see his brothers fighting their glorious last stand, could hear the clash of steel and the screams of the dying. Every fiber of him yearned to join them, to add his strength to theirs in this ultimate expression of their duty.

But the goddess held him fast, her smile a mix of cruelty and admiration. "Watch, my iron son," she purred, her voice somehow audible above the din of battle. "Watch as your brothers write their names in blood and glory."

"Let me go!" Raaf's voice was a growl of pure rage, his armor creaking as he strained against her invisible bonds. "Let me fight! Let me kill!"

The goddess laughed, a sound like clashing swords. "Oh, but your rage is exquisite, my champion. Feel it burn within you. Listen to the song of battle that your brothers conduct." Her eyes glittered with malicious glee. "Can you hear how sweetly they sing with blade and blood? How magnificently they dance amidst the chaos?"

Raaf's fury only grew, stoked by the goddess's words and his own helplessness. He watched as one of his brothers grabbed an enemy soldier by the head, smashing him into the ground with a sickening crunch. Another Iron Knight, his armor dented and bloodied, fought with a ferocity that bordered on madness, his sword a blur of motion as he cut down foe after foe. Raaf's eyes darted from one scene of carnage to the next.

"Nine songs of steel that play", the goddess whispered in Raaf's ear. Raaf's answer was a roar of pure, unadulterated rage. His armor creaked and groaned as he strained against the goddess's hold. With a loud crack, his whole body shifted forward just a fraction of an inch, before being frozen again. The goddess's eyes widened in surprise.

"The rage inside you..." she murmured, her voice low and unsettled.

Suddenly Raaf's eyes snapped to the goddess, his gaze burning with a fierce intensity. The air between them seemed to crackle with energy, the unstoppable force of Raaf's will clashing against the immovable presence of the goddess.

For a moment, time seemed to stand still. Then, with a sound like thunder, the invisible bonds shattered. The goddess stumbled back, her face a mask of shock. In the blink of an eye, she vanished, leaving behind only the echo of her astonished gasp.

The soldiers of the Eastern Empire surged forward, their confidence growing as they pushed back the defenders of Iplas. Victory seemed within their grasp. Then, a shadow fell over the front lines.

Those in the vanguard looked up, their eyes widening in terror. It was as if a mountain had suddenly decided to move, a titan of steel and fury descending upon them. Raaf, the Sentinel of the Iron Knights, had joined the battle.

His massive form seemed to blot out the sun, each step forward sending tremors through the ground. The arms-thick plate armor dull and menacing, splattered with the blood of fallen foes. In his hands, his sword as tall as a man looked like a mere extension of his terrifying form.

There was no battle cry, no roar of challenge. Only the ominous, thunderous footfalls as Raaf advanced. The silence was more terrifying than any war cry could have been, a promise of swift and merciless death.

The front line of the Eastern Empire's forces faltered, men stumbling over each other in their haste to retreat. But there was nowhere to run. Those who turned their backs found themselves crushed against the mass of their own army pressing forward, unaware of the horror that awaited them.

Raaf's first swing cleaved through a dozen men as if they were made of parchment. Bodies flew through the air, broken and lifeless before they hit the ground. The Sentinel moved with a speed that belied his massive size, each movement precise, efficient, and utterly devastating.

Blood sprayed in great arcs as Raaf's sword found its marks again and again. Men screamed in terror, their weapons seeming pitiful and useless against this juggernaut of destruction. It was as if death itself had taken physical form and was now stalking the battlefield.

The other Iron Knights, sensing their leader's presence, fought with renewed vigor. The defenders of Iplas, witnessing this turn of events, rallied behind the Iron Knights' unstoppable advance.

As Raaf carved a bloody path through the enemy ranks, the tide of battle shifted. The Eastern Empire's soldiers, who moments ago had tasted victory, now found themselves facing a nightmare made real. The siege of Iplas raged on, but now, with all ten Iron Knights unleashed upon the battlefield, the outcome was no longer certain.

The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows over the ruins of Iplas. What was once a proud city now lay in utter devastation. The castle walls, once formidable, were partially collapsed, reduced to rubble. Bodies and debris littered the streets, a grim testament to the ferocity of the battle that had raged for days.

The fighting still continued, but it was clear that the Eastern Empire had emerged victorious. Amidst the chaos and destruction, eight colossal figures lay motionless. The huge, bloody silhouettes of fallen Iron Knights were scattered across the battlefield, their massive forms partially buried under debris, surrounded by dozens of fallen soldiers – a stark illustration of the price of their last stand.

Two knights remained – Raaf and another, both clinging to the thinnest thread of life. Their once-pristine armor was now dented, cracked, and stained with blood – both theirs and their enemies'. They dragged themselves across the battlefield, each movement a supreme effort of will. Their prayers were not for salvation, but for the strength to kill just one more enemy before they fell.

Their movements were sluggish, a far cry from the swift precision they had displayed at the battle's start. Yet, even in their weakened state, they remained deadly. Each labored swing of their swords still carried enough force to cleave through armor and flesh with terrifying ease.

Raaf's last comrade fell first. With a final, mighty swing that felled three enemy soldiers, he collapsed to the ground, his armor clanging against the blood-soaked cobblestones. Raaf watched his brother fall, a low growl emanating from his helm as he forced himself to continue fighting.

Then, in an almost holy moment, Raaf's time came. His legs, finally giving out after days of ceaseless battle, buckled beneath him. He fell to his knees, using his massive sword as a crutch to keep himself from collapsing completely. His head hung low, the weight of his helm and his exhaustion too much to bear.

Suddenly, a golden light appeared before him, cutting through the gloom and smoke of the battlefield. With tremendous effort, Raaf raised his head. Before him stood a figure of the same stature as himself, clad in similar armor, but shimmering with an otherworldly, golden radiance.

The figure spoke, its voice resonating with power and compassion. "Raaf, last of the Iron Knights. You and your brothers have fulfilled your sacred duty. The Order of Duty has been honored beyond measure. Are you ready to go?"

Exhaustion permeated every fiber of Raaf's being. His response was barely a whisper, yet it carried the weight of absolute certainty. "With Contentment."

The golden figure nodded solemnly. In an instant, it vanished, leaving behind a lingering warmth in the air. Then, one by one, huge golden beams of light descended from the heavens, enveloping the fallen forms of Raaf's comrades. Their bodies, broken and battered, were lifted skyward, vanishing into the light.

Raaf looked up, his gaze following his brothers' ascension. A final beam of golden light crashed down upon him, enveloping him in its warm embrace. In that moment, all pain, all weariness fell away. As the light lifted him from the blood-soaked ground, Raaf felt a profound sense of peace wash over him. His duty was done.

The fighting around them seemed to pause as friend and foe alike watched this supernatural spectacle unfold. When the light faded, the Iron Knights were gone. All that remained were their massive swords, standing vertically where each Knight had fallen, driven deep into the earth like monuments to their incredible last stand.

The battlefield fell silent, the enormity of what had transpired sinking in. The swords of the Iron Knights stood as silent sentinels, a lasting testament to their unwavering duty.
