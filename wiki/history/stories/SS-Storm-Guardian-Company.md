# Short Story: Storm Guardian Company

Time: 349 AB before the Sixth Dark Storm until 349 AB before the Seventh Dark Storm

## Chapter 1

The wind lashed icy air against the soldiers. Like thunderous whip cracks, it struck the bare stone wall to their left, along which the soldiers, fearing neither death nor abomination, felt their way up the path. Wrapped in leather, fur, and iron, they strode determinedly and unstoppably up the Grade of Hope, that daring path that led to their destination, the Storm Watch. A beacon of humanity amidst the black mountains. The northernmost outpost ever built.

This bastion of research would be the new home for the next three months for the soldiers who were now making their way up the mountains in the night, only in the light of their torches. Each of them was battle-hardened, each had already stood on the battlements when a Dark Storm broke upon them, and each had proven themselves against hundreds of others. With pride and dignity, they wore the emblem of the 1st Storm Guardian Company on their shoulders: a compass with a lightning bolt needle pointing north.

They had been on the road for two days already, but a long way still lay ahead of them. Due to the weather, they had to reduce their pace and continue ascending into the night. On the way, there were only a few places where they could rest a little, protected from the weather, nature, and the creatures lurking out there in the darkness. Their goal for this night and the last stop before the Storm Watch was Felix's Plateau.

Like many of the names the Storm Guardians had for some things, this one too was steeped in gallows humor. The plateau was merely a small ledge, no more than a meter and a half wide. An overhang above, however, offered a little protection from weather and mountain, which is why during the construction of the Storm Watch, anchors had been installed in the rocky ground, to which the Storm Guardians now fastened their tents.

Even setting up and anchoring the thick, spartan leather tents already cost a lot of strength under the harsh conditions. The wind had steadily increased in the last hours of the ascent and pressed the soldiers against the rocks with unimaginable force. An hour before they reached Felix's Plateau, it had also started to rain, which meant that rain was whipped against them as they set up their sleeping quarters.

Platoon Commander Bheden's voice thundered over the deafening whistling of the wind. The storm that was louder than Behden's command voice had yet to be born. His men and women leaned with their entire body weight against the wind to bring the tent walls into position, but under Bheden's coordination, after about thirty minutes, the walls that protected them from the cold and the weather were finally standing. It was the first time in fifteen hours that the soldiers could rest. In small, specially built metal boxes, they warmed their food, and those who could, slept a little. Yes, some of them were even in the mood for jokes. What meant mortal fear for many others was just the beginning of their service for the soldiers of the Storm Guardian Company. Admittedly, there was fire, water, and warm beds at the Storm Watch, but every one of the soldiers knew that this was only the pleasant tiny fraction of what awaited them up there.

Bheden sat on his thick sleeping bag, somewhat apart from the others, and devoured the stew in his hand. The fifteen hours of ascent had also drained his strength. Every time he began his service at the Storm Watch, he admired each of his men and women. But he admired even more the scientists who carried out their research so important to the Arch-God Kingdom at the Storm Watch. They were anything but trained soldiers, and yet, when it came down to it, they were as tough as dogs. Usually, the Storm Guardians escorted one or two of them up or down. This time, no scientist had been assigned to them, which Bheden was quite glad about. Not because the scientists would have slowed them down, but often this meant that additional research instruments had to be transported upwards.

During this ascent, he preferred to focus his attention on Munkhub, the newest member of the platoon. Although Munkhub, like each of them, could have taken on a fully grown bull in stature, the ascent was a struggle for him. It took a few years with the Storm Guardians before one really got used to their missions. Much also came with experience. All in all, however, Bheden was satisfied with Munkhub's performance.

To be able to lead his troops again in the morning, Bheden decided to get a few hours of sleep as well. He informed his first officer, Lieutenant Kun, and then made himself comfortable in his sleeping bag. Although wind and rain swept over their camp with a deafening roar, he was fast asleep after just a few minutes, another skill one learned after years with the Storm Guardians.

It was Daim, a Storm Guardian in the second generation and a close confidant of Bheden, who tore him from his sleep.

"Sir, a group of Wisps has discovered our camp and is attacking us-"

Before he could finish his sentence, Daim was knocked off his feet as suddenly the entire mountain began to shake. Above them, it thundered so loudly that one could no longer hear one's own voice. Bheden thought it was the storm, but as the thundering came down on them from above, he knew what was coming.

"TO THE WALLS!!!"

With a leap, Bheden had jumped out of his sleeping bag. Without hesitation, he grabbed Daim by the collar and jumped with him to the rock face. Just in time, because a second later, huge boulders crashed past the walls of their camp into the abyss. No sooner had the rock avalanche passed them than they could already hear the next one breaking loose above them.

Bheden looked around and spotted Kun, who was also pressed against the rock face with some men a few meters down the mountain.

"KUN!"

Immediately the lieutenant looked up at him and watched him attentively. Bheden asked him for info using hand signals, whereupon his first officer showed a four with one hand and pointed to the opposite mountain with the other. Bheden immediately stepped forward to the leather walls and pushed them aside a little so that he could see outside. The rain promptly lashed against him, but indeed, almost directly opposite, he saw four bright white lights flashing between the rocks. Suddenly one of them shot through the air in a serpentine line and disappeared outside of Bheden's field of vision above him on the mountain. Immediately, it rumbled through the mountain again and the thunder of the approaching rock avalanche became much louder. Meanwhile, the Wisp reappeared in the same place where it had previously hovered next to the others.

The platoon commander flinched as the air around him suddenly contracted and a moment later explosively expanded with incredible force. At the same moment, a bright yellow flash of lightning struck a few hundred meters below the Wisps opposite.

Kun had the soldiers set up and fire a Wisp Scare! However, they had narrowly missed their target. With a jolt, it became dark in front of Bheden as another rock avalanche thundered over them. He retreated from the abyss and looked down at Kun, who was already coordinating the reloading.

"KUN DOUBLE PROPELLANT CHARGE ORANGE!"

The lieutenant gave him a thumbs up.

"ON MY COMMAND!"

Again, his old comrade signaled with a thumbs up that he had understood. Heavy stones and boulders were still crashing into the abyss behind the leather walls. With one hand, Bheden grabbed the rock face behind him and closed his eyes. He concentrated entirely on the vibration of the mountain. After a few seconds, he felt it slowly subsiding and Bheden got ready to give the order. Three. Two. One.

"KUN NOW!"

Again, the air around them contracted briefly before it literally flew around the soldiers' ears, closely followed by the explosion of the impact. Then, for a moment, something almost like calm set in, until the soldiers' ears readjusted to the normal volume of the wind.

"Did we get them, Kun?!"

"Sir, hit and sunk!"

He raised his fist in triumph.

## Chapter 2

The rest of the ascent proceeded without problems, to Bheden's relief. With nearly a day's delay, they finally reached the summit. The Storm Watch towered almost twenty meters high and resembled an observatory from the outside. This similarity was not by chance, for the Storm Watch also housed a giant telescope inside. However, this one was directed downwards to look deep into the Land of Abominations. Besides the telescope, there were countless other instruments and apparatuses in and around the Storm Watch, the purpose of which neither Bheden nor any of his soldiers exactly understood, but they didn't need to. They all understood only one thing, that these instruments were the key to saving lives, and that's why they were ready to give their own in battle for all of this.

The second platoon of the Storm Guardians was already waiting in front of the Storm Watch to be relieved. The soldiers lined up opposite each other in rank and file, each behind their commanders. On one side, you could see the effects of three months at the Storm Watch; on the other side, the heartily little anticipation for this experience.

As tradition demanded, the platoon commander of the outgoing crew, Shield Lieutenant Luchuft, saluted first. Bheden returned the military greeting with a stiff gesture.

"Shield Lieutenant Luchuft, Platoon Commander of the second platoon of the first Storm Guardian company, requests takeover of the watch commanded by Arch-God King Nathanyell."

Bheden looked at the men behind Luchuft and nodded.

"Captain Bheden, Platoon Commander of the fifth platoon of the first Storm Guardian company, takes over the watch. Tavall Maniir Nathanyell."

"TAVALL MANIIR NATHANYELL, NATHANYELL, NATHANYELL!"

The soldiers' call echoed across the square in front of the Storm Watch as they paid their respects to the Arch-God King with their right fist in front of their chest. Again, the two platoon commanders saluted each other before both turned around and commanded their men.

"Men! Welcome to the Storm Watch! You have exemplarily survived the ascent, now our service begins and I expect the same discipline as in the last four days. We are on our own here. There is no reinforcement, no cavalry or supply troops that can pull us out of the shit. This building and the equipment and scientists in it are under our protection. Help each other, look out for each other and report anything that seems strange to you. Haaaa Rugh."

"HAAAA RUGH!"

Bheden turned to his first officer.

"Kun, you take over the troops. Quartering and control walk. See that Munkhub pays attention."

The lieutenant nodded.

"Understood, boss!"

Thereupon Bheden turned away and strode over to Luchuft, who was standing somewhat apart from the second platoon together with his first officer. Behind him, Bheden heard Kun giving commands in perfect military style. He smirked, because this would change drastically in the coming days and weeks. During service at the Storm Watch, there were only a few days when everything went according to regulations, at the beginning and at the end. Once you had lived with your men in close quarters for a few weeks, the military interaction with each other in everyday life quickly ceased.

"Shield Lieutenant Luchuft!"

"Captain, sir!"

"How is the situation at the moment?"

The platoon commander of the second platoon nodded his head and made a thoughtful face.

"It's hard to say, to be honest. The last few weeks have been extremely quiet, there have been almost no sightings, which in my opinion is a good sign."

"But?"

"The scholars believe that something is afoot."

Bheden's expression became more serious.

"A Dark Storm?"

"They don't know."

They stood silently next to each other for a few minutes, lost in thought. Bheden didn't want to imagine what would come upon them in the next few months. He hadn't spoken to the scientists yet, but judging by Luchuft's facial expression, the signs were not good.

The last Dark Storm had been 23 years ago, so long that the Storm Guardians had already had to accept members like Munkhub, who were either children at that time or not even born yet. A dangerous gamble, but they had no choice. The Storm Guardians viewed this development with mixed feelings. Of course, none of them would want to experience a Dark Storm, on the other hand, they didn't know if the end of this dark era had really come now. One thing was certain, however: with every storm-inexperienced soldier they had to accept, the Storm Watch became more vulnerable. No training, however hard, could adequately prepare a person for this hell.

"Captain, sir, Corporal Vorsk reports second platoon ready to march!"

The three officers turned to the broadly built corporal who had just made the report.

"Very good. Lieutenant Junnem, go ahead, I'll join you shortly."

Luchuft's first officer nodded briefly and followed the corporal to the other soldiers. Now that they were alone, Luchuft took a step closer to Bheden and lowered his voice so that only the captain could understand him.

"If it really is as the scholars say..."

Luchuft paused for a moment. He grabbed Bheden by the shoulder, less as a soldier but more as a long-time friend who was seriously concerned, and looked him deep in the eyes.

"Then may the gods grant you light."

Although these words gave him more than just discomfort, Bheden was grateful for Luchuft's honesty.

"May they also grant you light in the homeland."

With these words, the two turned away from each other. Luchuft went to his men and began the descent. Bheden let his gaze sweep one last time over the Black Mountains and the Land of Abominations, which stretched out on the horizon, before he entered the Storm Watch with an uneasy feeling in his stomach.

## Chapter 3:

No sooner had Bheden set foot inside the Storm Watch than he was greeted by that familiar old smell, a mixture of troop barracks, attic, masonry, mountain air, and study room. This peculiar blend of various scents was not by chance, for these were exactly the functions that the Storm Watch fulfilled. Spread over seven floors, two of them blasted out of the mountain, one found everything the Storm Watch needed both as a research station and as an independent outpost.

Kun had already brought Bheden's things to his quarters while he was still talking to Luchuft. The word quarters, Bheden thought, was with all due respect a more than exaggerated term for a small, cramped room with nothing more than a bed and a desk. In general, he found that comfort had been generally dispensed with in the Storm Guardians' accommodations. At least over the years, the individual platoons had repeatedly brought material and tools to the Storm Watch to improve some things themselves. For example, the mattresses had been made of finest down for several years, procured on behalf of the company.

That first day finally ended without any special incidents. The soldiers moved into their sleeping quarters and posts assigned to them by Bheden for this week and checked the entire building. Afterwards, they concluded the day together at the table with the scholars and a decent amount of Niira, the only true cider of the Forelands.

In the following days, there was still much to do for the soldiers until they had fully settled in. Almost a year had passed since they had last completed their service at the Storm Watch. Much had changed, especially the terrain around the Storm Watch. Some paths were only difficult to access, buried, or simply no longer existed at all. Under Bheden's instruction, about thirty of the soldiers spent the first weeks just scouting the accesses to the Storm Watch and the surrounding area and creating danger profiles. This was not necessarily new for the Storm Guardians, but it reminded many of the times after the last Dark Storm. Morale and confidence were still high among Bheden's people, but you could already clearly see the uncertainty in each of their eyes. The orders, the statements of the scholars when they sat slightly drunk late in the evening in the common room, the increased readiness, everything indicated that something was coming for them.

Again and again, at the request of the scholars, Bheden put together escorts to accompany scholars to measuring stations and the like. Again and again, they encountered stray creatures from the Land of Abominations. In itself nothing unusual, but the number of encounters increased week by week. The Storm Watch was not spared either.

In the second month, the number of encounters finally flattened out, at least it seemed so at first. On the night of the seventeenth day, however, the sleeping Storm Guardians were torn from their sleep by the alarm bell of those on watch. This time it was Kun who was sleeping and Bheden who already had the helm in hand when his first officer came rushing down the stairs.

"To arms, men! Go! Go! Go! The devil is at the door and wants to get our asses!"

"Bheden, what's going on?"

"One to two platoon strengths of Rotted Ones are approaching the Storm Watch over the Northwest Pass. Kiem spotted them during the night patrol."

Kun's eyes widened, suddenly wide awake.

"One to two PLATOON strengths?"

Bheden just nodded with pressed lips while waving through the soldiers who were still hastily running down the stairs. Groups of abominations could occasionally get lost to the Storm Watch, but with units of platoon strength consisting of the same creatures, any coincidence ceased to exist for Bheden.

In a few minutes, the soldiers stood in full gear, equipped with various weapons, in front of the Storm Watch. Kun divided them into combat groups, while Bheden stood beside them, mentally preparing for what was coming at them. The first group, consisting of fifteen men, stayed at the Storm Watch. Their task was to support the fighters, care for the wounded, and defend the Storm Watch against possible further enemies. The remaining groups, two and three, took up position at the Northwest Pass.

A few hundred meters behind them the Storm Watch, in front of them the dark silhouettes of the mountains, the Storm Guardians stood waiting in the glow of their torches. The night was cloudy, which is why the moon only provided some light in isolated spots. If you listened carefully, you could already hear the nearly hundred Rotted Ones. The ghostly scraping and crunching of the bones that made up a large part of their decaying bodies grew louder and louder with each minute.

"Senior Private Nursk, light!"

Nursk nodded, nocked an arrow, turned to one of his comrades who lit the arrow with his torch, aimed and fired the burning arrow deep over the path in front of them. It flew no hundred meters when it disappeared into a black sea of moving decayed corpses. They were here.

"Shields!"

In a single coordinated sequence of movements, the first row of Storm Guardians rammed their large shields into the ground and braced themselves against them.

"Spears!"

Immediately, the spears specially equipped for fighting against Rotted Ones were pushed through between the shields. They had barbs attached to them that prevented the skeletal Rotted Ones from coming out of the spears again.

"Flanks ready!"

The men on the sides took up their fighting stance and were just waiting for Bheden's command.

Before they could see the Rotted Ones, they could smell them. A musty, decaying odor rose to meet them, but they had no time to complain about it. No ten seconds later, the gruesome creatures already rushed into the glow of their torches and with full force against the foremost row.

"Flanks now!"

Without hesitation, the Storm Guardians broke out from the sides with loud battle cries and caught the creatures in a pincer movement from all sides. Pieces and parts of the monsters were flying through the air everywhere, while the Storm Guardians mowed through their ranks like berserkers. Individually, they were easy opponents, unarmed and already dismembered with a powerful blow. In these numbers, however, they could be dangerous even to experienced soldiers. They wore no armor or weapons, but their bony claws were very well able to dig deep into the flesh of their victims.

Bheden had also plunged into the fray and was right in the middle of it. With mighty blows, he let his broadsword crash into these abominable creatures, so that bone splinters were flying through the air. Again and again, these cunning abominations tried to pick out individual Storm Guardians and isolate them from the others, but Bheden had trained his men well. So he saw just in time how some Rotted Ones were trying to drive a wedge between Bheden's group and Munkhub. Like a bull, the captain took a run-up and rammed a path into the creatures. Promptly they turned their attention to the new enemy and fell upon him. With great effort, he fended off three Rotted Ones with his broadsword and pushed them back. Fortunately, Munkhub quickly realized what was happening and gave his commander cover. So they stood there now, surrounded by Rotted Ones, who stared at them bloodthirstily through their empty eye sockets.

Together they fought their way back to the others. Their swords literally split the bony bodies of the Rotted Ones in half. Bheden had completely come into his element, because even though he carried a lot of responsibility and as commander of a Storm Guardian platoon no longer stood on the battlefield so often, he was still a warrior at heart. It gave him an unspeakable strength when he felt his sword shattering the bones of these repugnant creatures beneath it. As if something was supporting him in it. He had already heard legends about some warriors on the Bulwarks who, after days of battles, had learned the ability to deal divine blows. Maybe this was a weakened form of it, maybe he was just imagining it.

The fight went on for half an hour until finally the last Rotted One went down with a pitiful screech. However, the Storm Guardians did not remain completely unscathed, there were also some wounded among them, fortunately no dead, although Gresk had come close. Back at the Storm Watch, Bheden ordered increased watch readiness for the first group that had remained at the Storm Watch during the fight. The rest were allowed to return to their beds, or were cared for by the medics. Afterwards, Bheden handed over command to his deputy, who had remained as commander with the first group, checked on his men one last time, and finally fell exhausted into his bed, where he almost immediately fell into a deep and confused sleep.

## Chapter 4:

It was already shortly before noon when Bheden woke up the next day. He immediately got dressed and went downstairs. Before he went to the dining hall to prepare his breakfast, he made a quick stop at the soldier of the day. Bheden was surprised when he saw who it was today.

"Shield Private Tuem? You're soldier of the day? Weren't you among the fighting groups last night?"

"Yes, Captain, but I assured Lieutenant Kun that I could perform my duty unimpaired."

He nodded to her in recognition, until he remembered why he was here in the first place.

"Tell the scholars and Lieutenant Kun that I'm calling a meeting in half an hour."

She saluted casually.

"Will be done, Captain!"

Bheden nodded to her again before turning around to attend to his breakfast. He hadn't eaten anything after the fight yesterday, which is why his stomach was now growling quite a bit. The food at the Storm Watch was partly grown in a garden next to the main building, but mostly transported to the Storm Watch by the Storm Guardians. Thus, each platoon included five mules with one wagon each. The mules were slaughtered upon arrival at the top.

After an extensive breakfast, Bheden made his way to the large research room on the second floor, where the giant telescope was also located. The scholars and Lieutenant Kun were already waiting for him there.

"Ah, the Captain!"

"Good morning to you too, Domhnallach."

Domhnallach was the chief scholar at the Storm Watch and thus spoke for all scholars. He shook Bheden's hand with a smile and stepped back a bit to give him some space.

"I believe you've all witnessed yesterday's events, so I'll spare you the elaborations and keep it brief."

Those present nodded in agreement.

"For me, the signs are clear and point to an impending storm, BUT I'm not a scholar or a man of science, so I seek advice from you. I know that none of us want to experience another Dark Storm, yet I appeal to your reason. Even if there might be a small chance that all of this is just coincidence, what is the current honest and not fear-driven assessment."

For a moment, there was an awkward silence among the scholars, until one named Smios stepped out of the crowd.

"You're right. There's no point in denying a coming Dark Storm anymore. We've been researching and calculating so intensively in the last few days as we haven't in a long time, hoping to somehow explain the signs differently, but the time has come to realize that the Era of Storms is not over yet."

Some of the scholars nodded in agreement. Domhnallach stepped beside the young scholar and put his hand supportively on his shoulder.

"Captain, I'm afraid Scholar Smios is right. In the last 23 years, hope for an end to this horror has grown, and this hope has probably clouded our way of thinking a bit."

The chief scholar turned to his colleagues and spread his arms.

"Let's begin with what we should have begun days ago, calculating the size of the impending storm."

With newfound fighting spirit, the scientists raised their fists in the air. Immediately they scattered in all directions and dug out apparatuses, boards, and books from all corners and ends. Meanwhile, Domhnallach turned back to Bheden and Kun, who had joined his commander.

"Captain, I need a troop of brave and capable soldiers."

"You'll get them, just tell me what for and how many."

"Four or five of your men must get us some samples near the Land of Abominations. With these samples, we can more accurately predict the size and especially the timing of the Dark Storm."

Bheden looked at him with a serious expression. He knew that if anyone could get so close to the Land of Abominations, it was his soldiers, but he also knew that they would likely not come back. With anticipatory bitterness, he nodded to the chief scholar.

When Bheden explained the situation and mission to his soldiers gathered in the dining hall, a murmur went through the Storm Guardians, and yet in the same breath, over a dozen volunteered. Without batting an eye, they stood there, stiff and with serious expressions on their faces. Now the Captain faced an extremely unpleasant choice.

"Men, it honors me to see how many of you volunteer for this daring mission, but in the end, I can't send more than five on the journey."

The Storm Guardians nodded understandingly. After brief consideration and consultation with Kun, Bheden had decided on five of them.

"Sergeant Daim, Sergeant Katsk, Private Prustra, Private Zentanza, and Senior Private Kagen, you will get the samples."

The uncalled sat down again and applauded the five brave ones. Their commander also stood clapping in front of the crowd. He let them enjoy the recognition for a short while, as he knew exactly that for some of them it was probably the last they would get.

With a nod of his head, he signaled them to step forward. Together with the five, Bheden went back up to the scientists, where they received detailed instruction from Domhnallach and some other scholars. They were shown how to operate the device for the samples and where best to position it. Based on the maps and due to some old records, they estimated that the mission would probably take a good eight days.

And so the five, Daim, Katsk, Prustra, Zentanza, and Kagen, fully packed and with determination, started off from the Storm Watch two days later. Many of their comrades waved and whistled to them as they descended the North Path, until their silhouettes were finally lost in the distance.

Also to catch a possible glimpse of the five Storm Guardians in the north, the scholars and some of the soldiers scanned the north day in and day out for movement with their binoculars. What they spotted between the mountains on the morning three days after their comrades' departure, however, made their blood freeze in their veins. A pack of Bargs, bestial wolf-like creatures the size of a full-grown ox, was racing in their direction at full speed.

## Chapter 5:

With a powerful jerk, Bheden pulled his longsword from the lifeless body of the beast. Dark black blood flowed over the blade to the ground, where it joined a huge puddle that had formed during the fight.

Luckily for the Storm Guardians, only five of the over forty Bargs had set their sights on the Storm Watch, the rest had raced past several hundred meters below them, further towards the Forelands.

However, they hadn't come away unscathed; Pashem had been severely wounded by one of the Bargs and it looked bad for him. The trained healers of their platoon had immediately brought him into the Storm Watch, even during the fight, but his fate now lay in the hands of the gods.

The Captain stood somewhat apart from Pashem's bed, around which some of the Storm Guardians stood and helped the healers with full dedication wherever they could. It was cruel to watch. Where once a proud and so familiar face had been, only red shreds now hung from the bones. A large part of his right arm was missing and the rest was hardly recognizable as such. Again and again, the soldier's body writhed with weak movements, as if trying to shake something off, and Bheden knew this image all too well. Death was already bent over Pashem.

A knock tore Bheden from his thoughts. He had retreated to his chamber to sort out his feelings and fears.

"Come in!"

The door opened and Tuem entered with lowered head.

"Captain-"

She swallowed audibly.

"Pashem has fallen asleep."

Before answering, Bheden closed his eyes briefly and took a deep breath.

"Gather the men, we'll bury him tonight, who knows if we'll find time for it otherwise."

Tuem nodded, turned on the spot and hurried down the corridor.

Bheden stood up and looked out through the small window over the mountains. So this was it, the beginning of hell, and they had a seat in the front row.

The Storm Guardians had gathered in front of the Storm Watch in the glow of the torches and looked intently at their commander, who stood before them and slowly nodded.

"Men, today is a dark day, for today, Pashem, a Storm Guardian in highest honors, a comrade, a friend, has fulfilled his duty. In battle for no less than his homeland, his family, and above all his comrades, he showed exemplary courage and bravery. Tavall Maniir Pashem."

"TAVALL MANIIR PASHEM!"

The soldiers remained in their salute for a moment before lowering their fists again.

"Today we will celebrate Pashem, think of him and give him a worthy farewell, as long as this is still possible for us. I want you to know that I too am afraid, afraid of what is inevitably coming upon us. But I also want you to know that I will defend this building and each one of you to my last breath with every fiber of my body. I will not yield until we are relieved, for I have sworn to keep watch even in the darkest of storms."

The Storm Guardians thrust their fists into the air with a deafening battle cry, for they too would not take a step back even in the face of the hordes of hell. Their service only ended when they stood before the gates of the gods.

With a brief nod, the Captain stepped aside to clear the way for his men. The torches were passed forward from everyone to the first row. The Storm Guardians formed a line in front of the large stone mound under which Pashem's body was buried.

As tradition demanded, the closest comrade had to light the grave of a fallen one. Buried on the mountain, under black stone, honored and purified by fire, the Storm Guardians believed that their fallen comrades continued to protect them in the afterlife.

Ebraca, Pashem's closest friend and first in line, stood motionless for a moment with his torch in front of his comrade's grave. He looked around at his comrades with a mourning expression, who stood directly behind him and nodded to him understandingly. Some who stood directly behind Ebraca put their hands on his shoulders to give him the support he would need now. Slowly, the young soldier lowered his torch to the black, oil-soaked stones. As the flame reached them, the fire hissingly enveloped the small mound and bathed the surrounding landscape in a gloomy orange light.

Man by man, the Storm Guardians symbolically dipped their burning torches into the blazing fire in turn. Afterwards, all but six of the soldiers went back to the Storm Watch. These six soldiers formed the death watch. They would protect their comrade's grave in complete silence this night, so that he could ascend to the realm of the gods in peace. Ebraca was not among them, tradition forbade this. It was believed that in his condition, he was not capable of holding a worthy death watch. That's why it was all the more important that he represented Pashem's spirit at the celebration and, as his closest comrade, told his stories one last time for all, the sad ones, the funny ones, the good ones, and especially the honorable ones.

Bheden stood with a serious expression next to Kun and watched his men as they said goodbye to their comrade.

"Black are the mountains and their soul."

Kun nodded and replied with the old traditional answer of all those soldiers who served in the Black Mountains.

"Black is the night and its creatures."

Back in the Storm Watch, a great feast began in honor of Pashem. The celebration went on long into the night, only Bheden, Kun, and Katsk said goodbye already around midnight. Together they sought out the chambers of the chief scholar to talk to him about the results.

However, they didn't find him in his chambers; instead, almost all the scholars were still in the large research room. Even when the three Storm Guardians entered, the scholars continued to discuss loudly. Only when Bheden made himself noticed with a loud clearing of his throat did they fall silent. It took a while until the chief scholar seemingly remembered his duties again and greeted the three.

"Captain, you're back. I've heard of your loss and would like to express my condolences on behalf of all of us."

"We appreciate that."

For a while, there was an awkward silence in the room. Bheden got the feeling that the scholars didn't really want to talk to them right now. That might be so, but it absolutely didn't matter to him at this moment.

"Chief Scholar."

The chief scholar seemed to gradually understand that the three wouldn't be shaken off so easily and gave in.

"I assume you're here to get a situation report."

The Captain nodded briefly and looked expectantly at Domhnallach, who just folded his hands in front of him and stepped back a bit.

"Well... the situation is... complicated, to put it simply."

"What's that supposed to mean, we gave you the measurements you wanted, didn't we? Weren't these supposed to bring clarity, Chief Scholar?"

"They should indeed, but they haven't, Captain. Rather, they've only made the picture even more blurred than it already was."

The Captain looked at him with uncomprehending glances.

"You see, many of our measurements and observations unequivocally point to a Dark Storm, but some important key data, including the measurements in the north, are much lower than they should be. Something like this has never happened before. Whatever is coming for us can't be predicted. The next weeks will show whether it will be a Dark Storm or something never seen before. Based on the measurements that do point to a Dark Storm, I can only say one thing with certainty, when the cataclysms roll over us, only the gods can help us."

## Chapter 6:

Pitch-black clouds darkened the sky over the Black Mountains. For days now, times of day had been merely a construct for the Storm Guardians, one that neither the sun behind all the clouds nor the hordes of abominations seemed to adhere to.

A massive, dark red lightning bolt struck just a few meters next to the Storm Watch and illuminated the battlefield around it for a moment. Everywhere lay lifeless bodies, limbs, rubble, debris, and ash, and in the midst of this chaos, the Storm Guardians fought against hundreds of enemies who seemed to virtually overrun them.

Of the once nearly 70-man strong platoon, only about half remained. For nine days now, they had been fighting non-stop for their survival. At first, they had still formed shifts, now they slept whenever they could. However, there were rarely more than thirty minutes between attacks.

Thousands of meters below them, tens of thousands of beasts, monsters, and other abominations raced past, with only one bloodthirsty goal in mind - the land of humans. But just as at the Storm Watch, they would also encounter unyielding resistance at the Bulwarks. Over a hundred thousand soldiers stood at their positions in each of the three Bulwarks, alerted weeks in advance by the Storm Watch. The entire Bulwarks Army Group and Bulwarks Army Supply Group were in action, additionally supported by the Forelands Bulwark Support Corps - divisions of the Arch-God King's Armed Forces whose sole task was the defense at the Black Mountains.

But all these soldiers couldn't help Bheden and the Storm Guardians who were left at the Storm Watch. They could only survive by fighting on and on until they could finally see the day on the horizon again, and Bheden knew that too.

With a skilled movement, the Captain parried a blow and immediately had to dodge the next. With a quick glance over his shoulder, he registered with shock four more tall Bar'a Guul storming towards him. Already, the black steel of a blade whizzed past his face by a hair's breadth and thundered into the right shoulder plate. Behden lost his balance, but immediately used this, quickly switched his sword to the other hand and thrust it with full force through the skull of his attacker. The Captain rolled off, pulling his sword out of the lifeless monster in the process, and promptly lunged at the four Bar'a Guul behind him.

He immediately rammed the first one down with his shield from the sprint. In a complete rage, he smashed this with the point forward into the monster to his right, causing blood to spray everywhere. For days now, the Storm Guardians had been covered with the tarry blood of the gruesome creatures. Thick black crusts covered the faces and equipment of the soldiers, only their blades still gleamed, constantly cleaned in the entrails of their enemies.

Day after day, more Storm Guardians fell, and those remaining inevitably lost strength. On the thirteenth day, Bheden, completely exhausted after another hours-long fight, collapsed just in front of the Storm Watch. Hardly any of his men were left, and soon he too would have to follow them into the afterlife. Of course, he was afraid, but he was too exhausted to even form a clear thought. Bheden didn't know how long he had been praying to the gods now, to all he could think of, just to be able to fight one more fight, but he didn't stop.

He didn't know how many of his men were dead. Again and again, one of those thought dead reappeared on the battlefield, or Bheden at least thought he had seen them. Marked by countless fights and completely drained, he pulled himself up on his sword and staggered to the edge of the plateau. Only in a few places could one still glimpse the ground beneath the countless corpses and cadavers, which already made the relatively short way a small challenge for Bheden.

Arriving at the edge, he sat down on a boulder and looked into the depths at his feet. Even from so high up, he could see the monstrosities as they rushed through the valleys, gorges, and rock crevices. He slowly let his gaze wander over the mountains out into the land of beasts when suddenly his heart leapt. In disbelief, he rubbed the dirt from his eyes, but the appearance wasn't deceiving!

Completely panicked, he shot up with new energy and stumbled over the cadavers towards the Storm Watch. A few of the soldiers who were also sitting completely exhausted in front of the main gate stood up uncertainly when they saw the Captain storming towards them.

"LIGHT! LIGHT ON THE HORIZON!"

For a moment, none of the soldiers moved.

"OPEN THE GATE!"

Awakened from their shock, they jumped to the gate and opened it so that their Captain could storm right in. Some of them immediately followed him. He rushed up the stairs to the large research room. The door nearly flew off its hinges as the Storm Guardians practically kicked it in.

"LIGHT ON THE HORIZON!"

The Storm Guardians shouted in complete disarray and kept pointing north and at the large telescope. The scholars immediately understood and rushed to the telescope and indeed! Light on the horizon.

The end of the sixth Dark Storm came faster than they had thought. On the same day, they were only attacked by a few more abominations, which they defeated with ease with their newly gained morale. Hour by hour, the light on the horizon came closer and the dark clouds moved over them to the south. Twenty-three Storm Guardians and six of the thirty scholars still held the Storm Watch.

The service of the fifth platoon was originally supposed to last only three months, now it would probably be one to two months more. The Dark Storm would also be over at the Bulwarks in a few days, and then it would take a few more weeks until the last abominations of the storm had arrived at the Bulwarks. They would probably send two or three platoons of Storm Guardians to relieve them. They would have to rebuild the Storm Watch and transport a lot of equipment to the Storm Watch, but all that would be irrelevant to Bheden and his men, as long as they finally came home from this hell.

The Storm Guardians were just in the process of retrieving some of the bodies of their fallen comrades from the rubble and remains of the battlefield in front of the Storm Watch when one of the scholars suddenly appeared in the main gate and called out to them. But his voice failed at the first word. Some of the soldiers and Bheden trudged up to him and looked at him with questioning glances, waiting.

"Another storm is approaching..."

His voice failed again and he collapsed.
