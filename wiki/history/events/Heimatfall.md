# Heimatfall

The inhabitants of the Arch-God Kingdom refer to the second invasion of the Eastern Empire in the Eternal War as the Homeland Fall. During this invasion, the kingdoms of Lichtfall, Trivalon, and Neuhaven fell completely into the hands of the Eastern Empire, along with large parts of Solvalon and Bivalon.

## Course of Events

### Invasion

The armies of the Eastern Empire gather at the southern borders of the Arch-God Kingdom.

On 05.04.461 AB, the armies of the Eastern Empire gather at the borders of Lichtfall and Trivalon. The invasion consists of three "waves", each structured similarly to an army group. The waves have names and are of considerable troop strength:

- Raitonin Ebu (Lightning Wave) 3,500,000 men
- Surai Ebu (Slaughter Wave) 6,000,000 men
- Sandau Ebu (Thunder Wave) 10,000,000 men

At this time, the troop strength of the Arch-God Royal Armed Forces in the Arch-God Kingdom amounts to just under 15 million men. This means the Arch-God Kingdom is already numerically inferior with all its troops. This doesn't even take into account that almost all main combat groups were either destroyed in Operation Wisp or are struggling somewhere in the Free Lands.

The army lineup of the Arch-God Kingdom at the beginning is as follows:
- Army Group Solvalon 1
- Army Group Solvalon 4
- Army Group Vorlande
- Army Group Bivalon 1
- Army Group Fiendheim
- Army Group Hochcordt
- Army Group Kharis 1
- Army Group Kingdom of Guilds
- Army Group Lichtfall 1
- Army Group Trivalon
- Army Group Bulwarks
- Army Supply Group South
- Army Supply Group East
- Army Command Group Kluftfelder
- Valor Army Command Group (partially)
  - 4th-6th Command Corps
  - 3rd Special Corps
  - 2nd Reaction Corps
  - Supply Corps

A large part of the other army groups (about 90% each) are involved in Operation Wisp.

### First Year 05.04.461 - 05.04.462

Within the first year, the Eastern Empire conquers large parts of Trivalon. Huge battles on the vast plains of Trivalon cause heavy losses on both sides, but the Eastern Empire relentlessly pushes back the defending forces with its troops.

In Lichtfall, they make very slow progress due to the difficult conditions and dense forests. Army Group Lichtfall 1 offers fierce resistance and causes devastating losses to Raitonin Ebu in proportion to the small front section.

#### Battles in Trivalon
- 12.02.462 AB Assault on Offlion

### Second Year 05.04.462 - 05.04.463

The last defensive post in Trivalon falls into the hands of the Eastern Empire.

A year and almost two months after the war began, the last defensive post in Trivalon falls, marking the first major victory for the Eastern Empire.

Raitonin Ebu is allowed to withdraw and Surai Ebu takes over the assault on Solvalon with nearly 10 million fresh troops.

Not much is left of Raitonin Ebu, which is why Surai Ebu is no longer just supporting from Deniir onwards but takes over the second assault. A large part of Raitonin Ebu is allowed to withdraw or be overtaken. The few commanders who are left are highly decorated and used for propaganda.

The goal for Surai Ebu is clearly set: The storming of the main kingdom and seat of the Arch-God King, Solvalon. However, this proves to be much more difficult.
