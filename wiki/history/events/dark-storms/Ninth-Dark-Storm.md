# Ninth Dark Storm

The Ninth Dark Storm was a catastrophic event that devastated large parts of the Arch-God Kingdom from 396 AB to 397 AB. Lasting for 262 days, it was one of the most destructive Dark Storms in recorded history.

## Background

After the destruction of the Weave Convergers during the Eight Dark Storm, it was believed that the era of Dark Storms had come to an end. This assumption left the Arch-God Kingdom unprepared for what was to come.

## Onset and Causes

The Ninth Dark Storm broke out in 396 AB, catching the Arch-God Kingdom's forces completely off guard. It was fueled by several new Weave Convergers distributed across the kingdoms and nearly instantaneously triggered by two Abyss Amplifiers.

### Conspiracy

The storm's occurrence was made possible through a collaboration between the Eastern Empire and radical Abomination followers. The Eastern Empire infiltrated spies into the Arch-God Kingdom's hierarchies while simultaneously training radical Abomination followers in distant lands. Over decades, they established a network of Weave Convergers throughout the Arch-God King's realms.

This was the first part of their invasion plan to conquer the Arch-God Kingdom. The construction of two Abyss Amplifiers, located in the capitals of Solvalon and Fiendheim, took the longest time. The construction in Solvalon was nearly discovered and was only concealed through an extremely costly cleanup operation involving over 300 Eastern Empire spies.

## Impact on Kingdoms

### Forelands
The forces in the north took several weeks to form a unified front, as a large portion immediately rushed to the Bulwarks to defend the borders upon the storm's outbreak, expecting the storm to come from the north, as in all previous storms.

### Fiendheim
Left without support, the Fiendheim Army Group was completely overrun in just a few months. The Abyss Amplifier in the capital was only discovered after Fiendheim's fall.

### Hochcordt
Hochcordt saw intense fighting in the south during the first weeks, resulting in heavy losses due to the Strategic Command's decision to keep most forces stationed in the north.

### Kharis
Kharis managed to hold most of its territory in the first weeks, albeit with heavy losses.

### Solvalon
As the first kingdom, Solvalon was particularly hard-hit due to the Abyss Amplifier. Under the leadership of High Prince Gideon Hullereen var Kathen, the second son of the Arch-God King, the army group managed to hold strategically important cities, including the capital.

### Bivalon
Bordering Fiendheim and Solvalon, Bivalon's army group failed to hold the kingdom entirely, with most of the land falling within weeks, pushing people towards the coasts.

### Lightfall
Lightfall managed to hold most of its territory in the first weeks, suffering heavy losses.

### Trivalon
The Trivalon Army Group responded the fastest, setting up strategic command centers. After eight weeks of situation assessment, they decided to withdraw in an orderly manner to New Haven.

## Later Developments

### Four Months After Onset
The fall of Fiendheim pushed the Hochcordt Army Group further north, where they eventually regrouped with the Bulwarks and Forelands Army Groups, successfully defending the Forelands against the masses.

### Valor Army Command Group
Initially stationed on the Odros peninsula, the Valor Army Command Group immediately set out for home upon learning of the events. En route, they discovered a Weave Amplifier, thanks to experience gained during and after the Eighth Dark Storm.

## Aftermath

Lightfall, New Haven, and the Kingdom of Guilds, being the least affected by the Dark Storm, quickly became clear that they would have to take over the main supply of the Arch-God Kingdom until the other kingdoms could provide for themselves again.

The Ninth Dark Storm stands as a testament to the ongoing threat posed by Dark Storms and the complex political machinations at play in the world. Its artificial enhancement and the conspiracy behind it marked a new chapter in the history of the Arch-God Kingdom and its conflicts with the Eastern Empire.
