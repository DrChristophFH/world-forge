# Wereth's Last Cleansing

## Overview

Wereth's Last Cleansing, occurring in 2700 BB (Before Bulwarks), stands as one of the most catastrophic events in the recorded history of Eides. This cataclysmic occurrence resulted in the near-total obliteration of historical records predating it, creating a vast chasm in our understanding of the ancient world.

## The Event

While the exact nature of Wereth's Last Cleansing remains shrouded in mystery due to the very destruction it caused, scholars have pieced together some information from the scant surviving records and oral traditions.

It is believed that Wereth, presumably a powerful entity or perhaps a group, initiated a sweeping magical or technological process aimed at "cleansing" the world. The true intentions behind this act are lost to time, but its consequences were far-reaching and irreversible.

## The Implications of "Last"

The name "Wereth's Last Cleansing" carries a profound implication: that this was not the first such event to occur. The use of "Last" suggests that there were previous cleansings or attempts at cleansing. Further "Last" could also imply that this was the final cleansing, in contrast to just the most recent one.

However, due to the thorough nature of this final cleansing, almost nothing is known about these potential earlier events. The very effectiveness of Wereth's Last Cleansing in erasing historical records means that any information about previous cleansings has been lost along with other pre-2700 BB knowledge.

## Consequences

### Loss of Historical Records

The most significant and lasting impact of Wereth's Last Cleansing was the almost complete eradication of historical records predating 2700 BB. Libraries, archives, and repositories of knowledge across Eides were affected, their contents erased or destroyed. This loss created a historical dark age, with only fragments and echoes of the ancient world surviving.

### Cultural Amnesia

In the wake of the Cleansing, many civilizations found themselves cut off from their past. Traditions, lineages, and ancient knowledge were lost, forcing societies to rebuild their cultural identities almost from scratch.

### Technological and Magical Regression

It's theorized that the loss of records also resulted in the loss of advanced knowledge in various fields. Technologies and magical techniques that had been developed over millennia were forgotten, potentially setting back progress in these areas by centuries or more.

## Surviving Knowledge

Despite the thoroughness of the Cleansing, some information did survive:

1. Oral Traditions: Some cultures managed to preserve fragments of their history through oral storytelling, though these accounts often became mixed with myth over time.

2. Hidden Caches: A few well-hidden or magically protected repositories of knowledge escaped the Cleansing, becoming invaluable sources of pre-Cleansing information.

3. Archaelogical Remains: Physical artifacts and ruins have provided some insights into the pre-Cleansing world, though interpreting them remains challenging.

## Impact on Historical Study

Wereth's Last Cleansing created a distinct "before" and "after" in the study of Eides' history. Scholars often refer to events as either "pre-Cleansing" or "post-Cleansing," with the former being subject to much speculation and debate due to the scarcity of reliable information.

## Theories and Speculations

Many theories exist about the nature and purpose of Wereth's Last Cleansing:

1. Divine Intervention: Some religious groups believe it was an act of god(s) to reset the world.
2. Magical Catastrophe: Others speculate it was an experiment or spell gone horribly wrong.
3. Deliberate Erasure: A few scholars propose it was a deliberate attempt by some group to hide or erase specific parts of history.

## Speculations on Earlier Cleansings

While concrete information is non-existent, scholars have proposed several theories about these implied earlier cleansings:

1. Gradual Escalation: Some theorize that the cleansings might have started on a smaller scale, perhaps targeting specific regions or types of knowledge, before culminating in the all-encompassing Last Cleansing.

2. Failed Attempts: Others suggest that previous cleansings might have been attempted but failed to achieve their goals, leading to the more drastic and successful Last Cleansing.

3. Cyclical Events: A more controversial theory posits that cleansings might have been a cyclical occurrence in Eides' history, with civilizations rising and falling in between periods of enforced forgetting.

4. Different Perpetrators: Some scholars speculate that earlier cleansings might have been carried out by different individuals or groups, with Wereth being the last and most successful in a line of knowledge-destroying entities.

## The Mystery of Wereth

The identity of Wereth remains one of the greatest historical mysteries of Eides. Given the implication of multiple cleansings, some scholars have begun to question whether Wereth was an individual, a group, or perhaps even a recurring title or role in some ancient and secretive order dedicated to periodically "cleansing" the world's knowledge.

The true nature of Wereth, like so much else from before 2700 BB, remains lost in the mists of time, a tantalizing puzzle that continues to captivate historians and conspiracy theorists alike.
