# Draach's Dimensional Convergence

## Effect
During the triggered convergence, Eides and Bargol connect for several minutes before the dimensions are brutally driven apart again by the Magic Web.

The strongest connection with Bargol occurs in the Twilight Planes, which are closest to Bargol and already have a historical connection. Nevertheless, dark creatures from Bargol are drawn across all of Eides.

During the convergence, one of the most powerful fallen paladins from Bargol, Merengor the Darker, is also stranded on Eides in the Twilight Planes.

## Web Divergence
The explosive release of energy additionally leads to a previously unknown phenomenon of Magic Web displacement. The Magic Web is so strongly deformed temporarily that it practically has no influence on Eides anymore.

This phenomenon, which receives the name Web Divergence, lasts for almost a full year until the strength of the Magic Web increases again.

## Web Compression
Only when the Magic Web has regained its original strength does a research team of scholars in the Sanctum Sortis notice that Web Compression will occur. Due to the displacement of the Web of such great magnitude, the natural expansion and equilibrium forces of the Magic Web cause a collision of the Magic Web with itself.

The compression slowly increases until it reaches an incredibly high maximum for a short time and then flattens out again. During this time, mages have access to unimaginable energies.

It is assumed that with sufficiently large Web Divergence, the subsequent Web Compression can lead to a Dimensional Convergence.
