# Storm on Offlion

The Storm on Offlion, occurring on 12 Ros 462 AB, stands as one of the bloodiest battles in the first year of the Heimatfall. This pivotal engagement took place on the vast plains before Offlion, a major city in Trivalon, where two massive armies clashed in a brutal contest.

## Participating Forces

### Arch-God Kingdom of Men (AGKM) - Approximately 500,000 troops
- Royal Guard Corps of the Trivalon Army Group: ~80,000
- 7th Troop Corps of the Trivalon Army Group: ~75,000
- 8th Troop Corps of the Trivalon Army Group: ~60,000
- A portion of the 5th Rifle Corps: ~20,000
- 2nd Logistics Corps of the Southern Army Supply Group: ~55,000
- Command Corps of the Southern Army Supply Group: ~67,000
- Two Troop Corps of the Fiendheim Army Group: ~160,000

### Eastern Empire (EE) - Approximately 1,000,000 troops
- Raitonin Ebu: ~1,000,000

The sheer scale of the forces involved, with the Eastern Empire outnumbering the Arch-God Kingdom's forces two to one, foreshadowed the intensity and brutality of the battle to come.

## The Battle

The battle raged for three days, with the AGKM forces fighting fiercely against the overwhelming numbers of the Eastern Empire. Despite their valiant efforts, the AGKM troops were steadily pushed back as the battle progressed.

The ferocity of the fighting is exemplified by the experience of Shield Sergeant Khoram Aspar, a platoon commander in the 5th Troop Corps of the Fiendheim Army Group. Aspar and his comrades fought bitterly for three days, witnessing the fall of countless fellow soldiers. Aspar's desperate attempts to save his comrades often proved futile, a traumatic experience that would later shape his destiny.

## Significance

The Storm on Offlion represents a critical moment in the Heimatfall, demonstrating the Eastern Empire's overwhelming military might and the desperate defense mounted by the Arch-God Kingdom. The battle's outcome likely had significant strategic implications for the control of Trivalon and the broader conflict.

## Legacy

For many soldiers like Khoram Aspar, the Battle of Offlion left deep psychological scars. In Aspar's case, this battle marked the beginning of a fateful journey that would eventually lead him to become the infamous Iron Fall Butcher of Agoiir.

The Storm on Offlion stands as a testament to the brutality of the Heimatfall and the immense sacrifices made by soldiers on both sides of the conflict. Its memory likely lives on in the annals of military history and the nightmares of its survivors.
