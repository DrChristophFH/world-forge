# Operation Wisp

Under the codename "Operation Wisp" the Arch-God Kingdom prepared a large-scale invasion of the Eastern Empire from 413 AB. The name was chosen in the hope that even if information leaked, it would not be clear to the Eastern Empire whether this was a feint or not.

## Course of Events

### After the Battle of the Burning Plains 413 AB

Shortly after the Great Defeat of the Arch-God Kingdom in 413 AB in Kascar (Battle of the Burning Plains), the first plans for bringing about a quick end to the war were presented in the tactical high command of the Arch-God Royal Armed Forces. Relatively quickly, it was decided to implement a particularly unconventional plan by the young Shield General Gabriell Trenforth, a tactical command officer of the Northern Army Command.

The plan consisted of a massive sea-side invasion of the Eastern Empire. Through intelligence, it was known that the Eastern Empire, despite its massive defeat, was prepared for an invasion via Kraikar. However, the sea invasion would not take place over the Local Seas, as there was a risk of being encircled from all sides, as both Pveil, Schaaftaal, and Peadara were allied with the Eastern Empire, as well as Aunarach and even Baherech, despite its official alliance with the Arch-God Kingdom. Therefore, the plan envisaged circumnavigating the Free Lands in the North via the Kielpass.

### Preparations

#### Bulwark Harbor

Very early on, it became clear that the invasion fleet could not start from Forcier. The routes to the port were still much traveled despite the political situation, and it would have been impossible to smuggle an invasion fleet of such proportions past the coasts of Pveil and Grim.

Although Forcier was one of the largest ports of the Arch-God Kingdom, even it was too small to accommodate and supply thousands of ships. For this reason, the best architects of the country were commissioned to design and build a new port in the north of Kharis. The port was to provide space for about 16,000 ships. This enormous number posed quite a challenge, which however could finally be overcome with the help of the builders guilds and the experience of the port construction engineers from New Haven.

The newly created port was christened Bulwark Harbor to disguise the actual purpose of the port. Originally, it was considered to choose a name for the project that did not indicate a port or indicated a false area, but due to the size of the project, it was decided that this would be too conspicuous.

#### Shipyard 4

Located in the Bulwark Harbor was the so-called Shipyard 4. In this enormous shipyard, warships were built and designed in record time.

In the 30 years during which the preparations were running, the shipyard built more than half of all 16,000 ships that were used for the invasion.

#### Scout Ships

In the year 423, scout ships were sent out to reconnoiter the path of the invasion fleet. The ships all sailed under several false flags and had several camouflage measures to disguise the activity of the Arch-God Kingdom as much as possible.

Countless other scout ships with false papers and plans were simultaneously sent out in all directions from almost all major ports and also some secret military ports. Some of them even had direct orders to be captured by ships of other kingdoms, including the Eastern Empire. The crew of these ships consisted of trained and battle-tested commando soldiers who specialized in escaping from enemy captivity.

Passing the Kielpass turned out to be far more difficult than initially thought. Due to the centuries-long irrelevance of the Kielpass, there were no proper sea charts that provided information about the murderous underwater rock formations. Only a handful of locals who fished in this region could provide fragments of the necessary information, which often turned out to be wrong.

What was not known, however, was that the rock formations of the Kielpass changed over time. This was not noticed during the reconnaissance trips, which would have devastating consequences for the invasion fleet. These changes were also unknown to the locals, as the corruption of the Land of Abominations had displaced the natural ice region that resided north of the Kielpass before the Dimensional Convergence in 173 BB. Only in recent decades had this ice settled again, ensuring that the natural movement of the Kielpass over the seasons occured again. The massive deviation from the prepared sea charts for the invasion is also due to the much longer storm season in the year 458 AB, which delayed the departure by almost two months. In addition to the changed rock formations, there were also icebergs, both above and under water and the like.

### Invasion Fleet

The invasion fleet consisted of 11 army groups, namely:
- Army Group Solvalon 2
- Army Group Solvalon 3
- Army Group Bivalon 2
- Army Group Bivalon 3
- Army Group Kharis 2
- Army Group Kharis 3
- Army Group Lightfall 2
- Army Group Lightfall 3
- Army Group Lightfall 4
- Army Group New Haven
- Army Supply Group North
- Army Command Association Valor (partially)
  - 1st-3rd Command Corps
  - 1st-2nd Special Corps
  - 1st Reaction Corps

In total, the invasion fleet had a manpower of nearly 10 million.

The Army Group New Haven took the leading role in the invasion, as it was best specialized in seafaring. A small part of the land forces of the Army Group New Haven remained in the country to guide and instruct the support troops from Fiendheim and the Kingdom of Guilds in guarding New Haven.

### Departure 458 AB

### Kielpass

### Survivors

Only slightly less than 7 million men survived the Kielpass. 4 million came through the Kielpass intact and gather at a group of islands several hundred kilometers off the coast of Elestenid for a stocktaking. The rest of the 7 million survivors were scattered throughout the north around the Kielpass.

#### In the North of the Free Lands

Of the less than 3 million stranded, many found themselves in Grim and the Land of Abominations. Some were even driven to the north coast of Pveil, Wrogia, or as far as Ice Garden.

It takes weeks for the survivors to regroup in various locations. The information situation is extremely precarious, so most do not know how many have survived and where their comrades are stranded.

##### Grim
Number of stranded: ~900,000
Highest ranking: Colonel General Augustine Beresford

##### Land of Abominations
Number of stranded: ~700,000
Highest ranking: Colonel General Paul Sogard

##### Ice Garden
Number of stranded: ~320,000
Highest ranking: General Reyneke von Husen

##### Pveil
Number of stranded: ~80,000
Highest ranking: Colonel Mark Rolleston

##### Wrogia
Number of stranded: ~500,000
Highest ranking: General Amynedd Maylor

#### Returners

A handful of ships turned back in the chaos at the Kielpass and sailed back home. Although their act could have been accused of cowardice, the value of the information brought by the returners was quickly recognized, and all were pardoned. Most of the officers and non-commissioned officers played a major role in the further course and became a central component of the leadership in the Arch-God Kingdom of Operation Wisp.
