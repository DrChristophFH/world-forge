# Geography

Our world is composed of seven distinct planes of existence, each with its own unique characteristics, energies, and inhabitants. These planes are interconnected, influencing each other in ways both subtle and profound.

## The Seven Planes

### Eides - The Material Plane
[Eides](/wiki/geography/eides/Eides.md) is the central plane, most familiar to mortals. It's home to humans, elves, dwarfs and other common races. This plane is suffused with arcane energy, making it the primary source of magical study and practice.

### Anoxis - The World of Blood
A grotesque realm teeming with abominations, Anoxis pulses with the energy of life and corruption. Its landscape is as alien as it is horrifying, shaped by the whims of eldritch entities.

### Antikythera - The Clockwork Realm
Antikythera hums with the constant motion of gears and the flow of flux energy. This plane embodies order and mechanism, where even the laws of nature follow precise, predictable patterns.

### Bargol - The Shadow World
Shrouded in eternal darkness, Bargol is a plane of shadows and chaos. Reigned over by Bleak Lords, its ever-shifting landscapes defy mapping, and the chaos energy that permeates it gives rise to unpredictable phenomena.

### Eterfroest - The Frozen Wastes
An endless expanse of ice and snow, Eterfroest is the source of splitter energy. Its frozen beauty is as deadly as it is mesmerizing, home to creatures adapted to the harshest cold.

### Glunoth - The Runic Domain
Ancient runes cover every surface in Glunoth, a plane where knowledge is power. Rune energy flows freely here, giving life to golems and powering arcane machinery beyond mortal understanding.

### Infernus - The Infernal Plane
A world of fire and brimstone, Infernus burns with infernal energy. Demons rule this plane, their societies built upon the ever-burning landscape of volcanoes and lava rivers.

## Planar Interactions

The seven planes of Bulwarks of the North typically exist in isolation from one another. However, rare and cataclysmic events can occur that bring these planes into contact:

- **Dimension Convergences:** These are extremely rare and highly dangerous phenomena where two or more planes temporarily touch or overlap. During these events, energy and matter flow freely between the affected planes.
- **Catastrophic Consequences:** Dimension convergences often lead to unimaginable destruction on all sides. The mixing of incompatible energies and matter from different planes can result in reality-warping effects, the creation of monstrous hybrid creatures, or even the complete annihilation of large areas.
- **Unpredictable Occurrences:** The causes of dimension convergences are not fully understood, making them impossible to predict or control. Scholars and mages study these events from a safe distance, trying to unravel their mysteries.
- **Planar Artifacts:** Sometimes, objects or beings from one plane may be left behind in another after a convergence event. These remnants are highly sought after for their unique properties and the insights they can provide into other planes.

The rarity and destructive nature of these planar interactions make them the stuff of legends and nightmares. They serve as a constant reminder of the volatile nature of the multiverse and the delicate balance that keeps the planes separate.

Explorers, scholars, and adventurers dedicate their lives to understanding these planar interactions, as they hold the key to many of the world's mysteries and potential sources of great power.
