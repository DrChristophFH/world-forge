# The Free Lands

The Free Lands are an economic alliance between the countries east of the Arch-God-Kingdom. This agreement was made in 532 BB in light of the increasingly powerful and wealthy Arch-God Kingdom.

Originally, there were plans to also form military alliances, but no agreement could be reached on this type of alliance during the two-week conference due to the various interests of the participating countries.
