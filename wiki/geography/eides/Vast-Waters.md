# The Vast Waters

The Vast Waters mark the southern boundary of the known lands of Eides, an expansive and largely unexplored oceanic region that has captivated the imagination of explorers, scholars, and storytellers for centuries.

## Geography

Stretching beyond the horizon, the Vast Waters are characterized by their seemingly endless expanse of deep blue waters. The northern shores of this great ocean are dotted with bustling port cities and quiet fishing villages, serving as the last outposts of civilization before the unknown.

Notable features include:

1. The Mist-Shrouded Isles: A chain of small islands shrouded in perpetual mist, believed by many to be the gateway to the true mysteries of the Vast Waters.

## Exploration

Despite numerous attempts, no expedition has successfully mapped the full extent of the Vast Waters. The further south one travels, the more treacherous and unpredictable the waters become. Many ships have been lost to sudden storms, whirlpools, or simply by sailing off the edge of known maps.

Notable expeditions include:

1. The Voyage of the Starfire (372 AB): Led by the famed explorer Captain Elara Windwhisper, this expedition claimed to have sighted land far to the south before being forced to turn back due to dwindling supplies. The crews descriptions contradicted each other, and the expedition was largely dismissed as a hoax.
2. The Abyssal Descent (415 AB): A group of Monasterium Var Imperi scholars attempted to plumb the depths of the Vast Waters in the very south. They were never heard from again.

A lot of the exploration of the Vast Waters is done by the monster fishing industry in the southernmost ports of Eides, especially the Ports of Hybris in Cheohk. Though they do not use maps or traditional navigation and rely solely on their expertise. Claiming that maps and compasses are useless in the Vast Waters and wil only lead to death.

The so called "South Line" marks the most southern point of the Vast Waters that is considered safe to navigate. No ship has ever crossed this line with supporting evidence and returned to tell the tale.

## Legends and Mysteries

The Vast Waters are steeped in legend and mystery. Some of the most popular tales include:

1. The Sunken Kingdom: Rumors persist of an advanced civilization that sank beneath the waves millennia ago, its ruins waiting to be discovered by intrepid explorers.
2. The Storm King: A legendary aquatic creature said to command the winds and waves, capable of sinking entire fleets with a single gesture.
3. The Edge of the World: Some believe that the Vast Waters eventually pour off the edge of the world into the cosmic void.

## Cultural Impact

The Vast Waters have had a significant impact on the cultures of southern Eides:

1. Maritime Traditions: Coastal communities have developed rich traditions of seamanship, with rites and rituals to appease the capricious nature of the Vast Waters.
2. Trade and Economy: Despite the dangers, the abundance of unique resources (exotic fish, pearls, mysterious artifacts) from the Vast Waters drives a thriving trade economy.
3. Art and Literature: The mystery of the Vast Waters has inspired countless works of art, from epic poems to grand paintings depicting imagined landscapes beyond the known world.

## Current State

As of 543 AB, the Vast Waters remain largely unexplored. 

The Vast Waters continue to represent the boundary between the known and the unknown in Eides, a constant reminder of the world's enduring mysteries and the allure of discovery.
