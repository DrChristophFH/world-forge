# Grey Fields

The Grey Fields are a stark and barely fertile Lordship located directly behind the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md) in the Forelands.

## Geography

The name "Grey" Fields is not a misnomer. Despite their imposing size and seeming impenetrability, even the mighty [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md) cannot fully shield this land from the rot and corruption emanating from the Land of Abominations. Like a vile, death-bringing disease, this taint seeps through every tiny crack and crevice of the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md), slowly but inexorably poisoning the land beyond.

### Impact the Conquest of the Forelands

Due to the conquest of the Forelands in 64 BB, the last remnants of the Outcasts were eventually driven to the Grey Fields. Although many of them were killed in the process, some managed to escape their fate. Thus the majority of the people in the Grey Fields are descendants of the Outcasts and military personnel who were stationed there to protect the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md). 

This has led to a unique culture in the Grey Fields, with a strong emphasis on self-reliance and survival in the face of adversity. The people of the Grey Fields are known for their resourcefulness and ingenuity, as well as their fierce independence.

## Ecology

The Grey Fields are characterized by their ashen soil and sickly vegetation. What little plant life manages to grow here is often twisted and mutated, bearing little resemblance to its counterparts in healthier lands. The fauna of the region is equally affected, with many creatures exhibiting strange adaptations to survive in this hostile environment.

## Society and Culture

Despite the harsh conditions, the Grey Fields are not uninhabited. The people who call this land home are as hardy and resilient as the twisted flora that surrounds them. They have adapted to life in this corrupted realm, developing unique customs and technologies to survive.

## Strategic Importance

Despite its inhospitable nature, the Grey Fields serve a crucial role in the defense of the realm. The Lordship acts as a buffer zone, containing much of the corruption that would otherwise spread to more populous areas. The lords of the Grey Fields take this responsibility seriously, seeing themselves as the first line of defense against the creeping taint of the Land of Abominations.

## Politics

Due to its location directly behind the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md), thus being a necessary passage for all supplies and reinforcements to the Bulwarks, the Grey Fields are a highly contested region. The lords of the Grey Fields must navigate a delicate political landscape, balancing the demands of the Arch-God Kingdom with the needs of their own people.

Even though a small lordship often does not have the resources or means to defend itself politically, the Lords of the Grey Fields have never shied away from using their strategic position to their advantage. This notably includes the [Southern Border Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/forelands/Southern-Border-Watch.md).
