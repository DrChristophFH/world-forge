# Southern Border Watch

## Border Chicanery

With the construction of the Bulwarks, a unique opportunity arose for the Forelands, but especially for the Lordship of the Grey Fields, to become a thriving hub for goods and supplies. However, due to nepotism between the then-Lord of Trollfre and the Arch-God King, this opportunity quickly slipped away.

Enraged and full of envy, the citizens of the Grey Fields had to watch as the capital and seat of the Lord in Trollfre, Highcalere Castle, became increasingly pompous and magnificent with each caravan they processed. The Bulwark Routes proved to be a true gold mine for Trollfre. Tons upon tons of goods for the Bulwarks' garrisons were brought to Trollfre and handled or processed there.

In response to this injustice, the Lordship of the Grey Fields erected the Southern Border Watch decades later. Although operating customs posts in the Kingdom of the Forelands was prohibited by decree, the main purpose of the Southern Border Watch was to collect funds from the supply caravans.

However, the Lordship used a different system than simple customs duties, which were forbidden. They introduced inspections that often took forever with the gigantic caravans. As a result, thousands of complaints reached the Kingdom of the Forelands and even the Arch-God Kingdom from the caravans, the Bulwarks, and the Bulwark Logistics about the delays caused by the inspections.

The Lordship of the Grey Fields argued, however, that the inspections were absolutely necessary, claiming that the caravans were being used by thieves, riffraff, and other unwelcome guests to smuggle themselves and their loot conveniently in and out of the Grey Fields.

Nevertheless, the caravans received a special permit from the Arch-God King to enter the Lordship of the Grey Fields without inspection. In response, the Lordship staged several raids, thefts, arsons, murders, and whatever else they could think of, all of which they attributed to the alleged criminals who supposedly came to their lands via the caravans. With this argument, they demanded compensation for each caravan, which they finally received after long discussions.

Thus, the Southern Border Watch still stands at the border, almost without direct function, symbolizing the success of the Lordship of the Grey Fields in obtaining their embezzled money through barely legal means.

## Historical Context

The Southern Border Watch stands as a testament to the complex political and economic relationships within the realm. Its creation and continued existence highlight several key aspects of the world:

1. The economic importance of the Bulwarks and their supply routes
2. The power dynamics between different lordships, the Kingdoms and Kings and the Arch-God King
3. The lengths to which some will go to secure their perceived share of wealth
4. The tension between central authority (the prohibition of customs posts) and local governance

## Architecture and Function

While the Southern Border Watch was ostensibly created for security purposes, its true function as an economic tool is an open secret. The structure likely includes:

- Imposing gates and walls to control the flow of traffic
- Large inspection areas where caravans can be thoroughly searched
- Administrative buildings where "compensation" is collected and recorded
- Barracks for the guards who man the watch

Despite its reduced official function, the Southern Border Watch likely still serves as a symbol of the Grey Fields' autonomy and their refusal to be left out of the realm's economic prosperity.

## Cultural Impact

The Southern Border Watch has become ingrained in the culture of the Grey Fields. It represents their resourcefulness and determination in the face of perceived injustice. The quote from Lord Drathinid var Garretrance has likely become a popular saying in the region, used to justify all manner of schemes and plans to secure wealth and prosperity.
