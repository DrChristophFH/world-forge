# Thunder Forge

## In the Fire of [Eides](/wiki/geography/eides/Eides.md)

Visible even from the Tidal Bridge, the Thunder Forge towers high atop the peaks of the vulcano Aldngor, powered by its fiery hot lava. Aldngor lies on Vughdoruhl, the largest island of the Forelands.

Although dwarves are known to be very tough and resilient, the dwarves in the Thunder Forge are even more robust. In fact, there's a rumor in some areas that the dwarves there are made of stone themselves, as it would be impossible even for one of their kind to endure such unbearable temperatures day and night. In addition to the incredible extremes, the fact that very few are allowed to enter the Thunder Forge at all likely contributed to the persistence of this stubborn rumor.

Only those who are deemed worthy of its fire are allowed to enter the forge. Granted this honor one may enter the legendary grand halls of the Thunder Forge. However, the actual forging halls are strictly forbidden to anyone except the dwarves of the Thunder Forge. Not even other dwarves are allowed to enter them.
