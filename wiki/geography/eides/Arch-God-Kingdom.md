# Arch-God Kingdom

The Arch-God Kingdom, also known as the Arch-God Kingdom of Men, is a powerful and ancient realm in the world of Eides. It is a union of ten kingdoms under the rule of the Arch-God King, with a rich history spanning over two millennia.

## History

### Origins and Early History

The roots of the Arch-God Kingdom can be traced back to 1378 BB with the founding of the Kingdom of Dreoniell. This marked the beginning of a new era in the history of mankind in Eides. However, the true birth of the Arch-God Kingdom came centuries later in 799 BB, with the coronation of the first Arch-God King and the official founding of the Arch-God Kingdom of Men.

### Expansion and Fortification

As the kingdom grew in power and influence, it began to expand its territories and strengthen its defenses:

- 95 BB: Construction of the first fortifications in the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md) began, laying the groundwork for the future Bulwarks.
- 64 BB: The kingdom expanded its reach with the conquest of the [Forelands](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Forelands.md), which became the last of the ten kingdoms to join the Arch-God Kingdom.

### Era of Eternal War

The year 397 AB marked the beginning of the "Era of Eternal War," a period of prolonged conflict that would shape the kingdom's future:

- 400 AB: The Eastern Empire declared war on the Arch-God Kingdom of Men, initiating a long-standing rivalry.
- 413 AB: The Battle of the Burning Plains saw the defeat of Eastern Empire forces in Kascar, a significant victory for the Arch-God Kingdom.
- 458 AB: Operation Wisp, an attempt by the Arch-God Kingdom to invade the Eastern Empire, failed to pass through the Kielpass and resulted in heavy losses.

### Invasion and Rebuilding

The kingdom faced its greatest challenge during the Eastern Empire's invasion:

- 461 AB: [Heimatfall](/wiki/history/events/Heimatfall.md) marked the beginning of the Eastern Empire's invasion of the Arch-God Kingdom.
- 462 AB: Trivalon fell completely to the Eastern Empire's forces.
- 465 AB: A dark year for the kingdom, marked by the betrayal and murder of Arch-God King Kathen var Termenor and the fall of Kavaloniir and thus Solvalon.

However, the Arch-God Kingdom showed remarkable resilience:

- 477 AB: The Rahkam Offensive by the Arch-God Royal Armed Forces successfully recaptured Solvalon, Trivalon, Lightfall, Bivalon, and New Haven, marking a significant turning point in the war.

## Structure and Governance

The Arch-God Kingdom is a union of ten distinct kingdoms, each with its own king, but all under the supreme rule of the Arch-God King. The capital kingdom is Solvalon, which serves as the seat of power for the Arch-God King.

Three of these kingdoms - Solvalon, Bivalon, and Trivalon - are artificial constructs, created from the division of the original Kingdom of Dreoniell. This division likely occurred to distribute power and create a more stable governance structure.

The Forelands, the last region to join the Arch-God Kingdom, represent the expansionist nature of the realm and its ability to incorporate new territories into its complex political structure.

### Kingdoms

- **Solvalon**: The capital kingdom, known for its political significance and as the seat of the Arch-God King.
- **[Bivalon](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Bivalon.md)**: Sister kingdom to Solvalon in the west, it was established as part of the division of the original Kingdom of Dreoniell.
- **[Trivalon](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Trivalon.md)**: Second sister kingdom to Solvalon, located in the east, also created from the division of the Kingdom of Dreoniell.
- **Lichtfall**: The southernmost kingdom, known for its rich resources and fertile lands.
- **[Neuhaven](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Neuhaven.md)**: A kingdom that serves as a hub for trade and cultural exchange.
- **[Forelands](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Forelands.md)**: The most recent addition to the Arch-God Kingdom, established as a buffer zone against the Land of Abominations.
- **[Kingdom of Guilds](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Kingdom-of-Guilds.md)**: A unique kingdom and hub to the guilds of the Arch-God Kingdom.
- **Hochcordt**: A mountainous and scarce kingdom to the north, known for its rugged terrain and hardy people.
- **Fiendheim**: A kingdom of plateaus and grasslands, known for its seafaring culture and strong naval presence.
- **Kharis**: A kingdom of plains and forests, known for its vast agricultural lands and rich natural resources.

## Cultural Significance

The Arch-God Kingdom stands as a testament to human resilience and ambition in the world of Eides. Its long history, marked by periods of expansion, war, and rebuilding, has shaped the political and cultural landscape of the known world. The title of "Arch-God King" suggests a fusion of political and religious authority, hinting at a complex relationship between governance and faith in the kingdom.

The construction of the Bulwarks in the Black Mountains, which began in 95 BB, not only served as a defensive measure but also became a defining feature of the kingdom, so much so that it influenced the calendar system of the kingdom, and with the kingdom being the most dominant trading partner in the known lands, it also influenced the calendar system of the known lands.

## Legacy

The Arch-God Kingdom's influence extends far beyond its borders. Its ongoing conflict with the Eastern Empire has shaped the geopolitical landscape of Eides for centuries. The kingdom's ability to withstand invasions, internal strife, and the challenges of ruling a vast, diverse realm speaks to its enduring strength and the effectiveness of its unique governance structure.

As of 477 AB, with the recapture of key territories, the Arch-God Kingdom has once again proven its resilience and remains a dominant power in the world of Eides, poised to face whatever challenges the future may hold.
