# Storm Watch

## Overview

The Storm Watch stands as humanity's northernmost outpost, a testament to resilience in the face of overwhelming darkness. Constructed after the [Third Dark Storm](/wiki/history/events/dark-storms/Third-Dark-Storm.md) at the behest of [Barquin Prudenci](/wiki/people/Barquin-Prudenci.md), the first Grand Scholar of Storm Studies, this fortress serves as both a bulwark against the encroaching horrors from the Land of Abominations and a center for crucial research into the nature of the Dark Storms.

## Location and Construction

Perched precariously on the edge of known civilization, the Storm Watch was completed three years after its commission, around 400 AB. Its location, while strategically vital, places it in an environment aptly described by those who serve there as "one foot in hell."

## Purpose

The primary function of the Storm Watch is twofold:

1. To act as an early warning system for incoming Dark Storms
2. To facilitate ongoing research into storm phenomena and the threats that lie beyond the Bulwarks

## Garrison and Personnel

### Military Presence

The Storm Watch is permanently manned by at least one platoon from the 1st Storm Guardians Company. These elite soldiers are tasked with protecting the scholars and maintaining the fortress's defenses against both natural and supernatural threats.

### Scholarly Contingent

A team of scholars from the Institute of Storm Studies is always present at the Storm Watch as well. They are responsible for:

- Monitoring various measuring instruments and devices
- Conducting experiments and gathering data on storm activity
- Analyzing potential threats from the [Land of Abominations](/wiki/geography/eides/Land-of-Abominations.md)

### Rotation and Tour of Duty

Under normal circumstances, a company serves a six-month tour of duty at the Storm Watch. This rotation helps maintain mental and physical readiness in the face of the constant dangers and harsh conditions.

## Notable Personnel

- Chief Scholar Domhnallach (served until 349 AB, perished during the Sixth Dark Storm)

## The Journey: "Grade of Hope"

The route to the Storm Watch, nicknamed the "Grade of Hope" by the Storm Guardians, is notoriously treacherous. It presents multiple challenges:

1. Constant threat of attacks from creatures emerging from the Land of Abominations
2. Extremely difficult terrain, with narrow paths and steep climbs that challenge even experienced mountaineers
3. Harsh weather conditions typical of the extreme northern climate
4. Limited safe resting points along the journey, leaving travelers exposed to both natural and supernatural dangers

The perilous nature of this route serves as a stark reminder of the isolation and importance of the Storm Watch and those who serve there.
