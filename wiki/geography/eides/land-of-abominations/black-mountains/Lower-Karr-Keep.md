# Lower Karr Keep

Lower Karr Keep was a defensive stronghold located in the western section of the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md), built after the conquest of the [Forelands](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/Forelands.md) to secure the region against incursions from the [Land of Abominations](/wiki/geography/eides/Land-of-Abominations.md).

It was under heavy siege in 54 BB from Abominations, during which it was partly destroyed.
