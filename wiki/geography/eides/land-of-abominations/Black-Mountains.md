# Black Mountains

The Black Mountains form a natural barrier between the Land of Abominations and the Arch-God Kingdom of Humans. They came into existence during the great Dimensional Convergence in 173 BB and have been an integral part of the region ever since.

## Myths and Sayings

Over the centuries, several sayings and myths have become established among the soldiers stationed in the Black Mountains. The most well-known are:

- "The North never forgets."
- "Black are the mountains and their soul." Often answered with "Black is the night and its creatures."

### The North Never Forgets

This saying originates from the earliest days in the mountains and likely stems from the harsh conditions. Even the smallest mistakes or carelessness cost lives in the mountains. A custom developed among the soldiers to pay respect to the mountains. The night watch was always responsible for ensuring that a small fire burned at the Shrine of the North. After decades, this became a sacred sign.

### Black are the Mountains and Their Soul

A saying often used by soldiers when they saw or had seen something terrible. It often served as a way to process experiences better. Originally, it was used to shift some of the responsibility for what happened onto the mountains and their curse.

Over time, a response to the saying also became established: "Black is the night and its creatures." This quickly became a distinguishing feature of the soldiers in the mountains.
