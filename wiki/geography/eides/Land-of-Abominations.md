# Land of Abominations

## A History of the Abominations

Like almost all races in Eides, the origin of the Abominations lies in another dimension. In 173 BB, the fateful Dimensional Convergence occurred, causing the original home of the Abominations, Anoxis, to collide and merge with Eides. This created the area in the north of the Arch-God Kingdom that would become known as the "Land of Abominations" in the following years.

"Abominations" is merely the umbrella term for all the creatures that were now stranded on Eides, a term that was established after some time. Apart from their origin and seemingly unlimited aggression towards almost all other known races, the different monsters had little in common.

There were Barges, enormous wolf-like creatures with huge fangs and claws, but also Wisps, which appeared to be purely magical in nature and were considered to be much more intelligent.

Since a large part of the Abominations were apparently not satisfied with the northern territories where they had arrived, they constantly pushed further south into the Arch-God Kingdom. The army struggled for decades to keep the beasts in the north. However, they were unable to prevent larger hordes from repeatedly breaking through to the south, bringing calamity and devastation to the cities and villages there.

In 95 BB, some military units finally began to fortify and expand their outposts in the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md). Due to significant successes with these fortifications, the northern army command quickly recognized the potential of the mountains as a natural wall.

However, since the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md) lay several hundred kilometers behind the hitherto existing border of the northernmost kingdom, it was decided to occupy the lands in between. Up to this point, these areas had been infested with Abominations and inhabited by only one colony, the Outcasts. These were criminals, traitors, and those hostile to the Arch-God Kingdom who had been banished into exile. A blemish that the armed forces were to remove for the Arch-God King directly upon invasion.

With spring at their backs, 800,000 men marched to the border in 64 BB. Over the next two years, they advanced in three waves like a steamroller to the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md). The conquest of the new kingdom of the Forelands cost more than a hundred thousand soldiers and workers their lives, but afterwards, the lands were largely freed from the Abominations.

In the following decades, the armed forces concentrated on developing the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md) into a well-guarded border to the Land of Abominations. However, they had not considered that this was like poking a hornet's nest. The more fortresses and outposts the humans built, the more frequent and costly the attacks by the Abominations became. Especially the three largest routes through the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md) saw more and more battles. More and more soldiers and construction workers were needed for their defense, as the fortifications and walls were constantly being destroyed.

After numerous missions in the [Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md), the head of the fortification staff of the fourth pioneer corps of the thrid Solvalon Army, Lieutenant General [Bartholomew Slater](/wiki/people/Bartholomew-Slater.md), finally decided to find a solution to the problem. Together with countless renowned and talented architects, he created the concept of the first Bulwark in months of work. The design was enthusiastically accepted by the then Arch-God Queen and commissioned along with two more Bulwarks. This step ushered in the era of the great Bulwarks: the Bulwark of the Gods in the west, the Bulwark of the Titans in the north, and the Bulwark of Darkness in the east.
