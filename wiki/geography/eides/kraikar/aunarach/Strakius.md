# Strakius

Named after the never-drying spring of the same name that feeds the water supply lake of the city, the capital of Aunarach towers high above the dunes with its two gigantic towers.

## Structure

### Sanctum Sortis

Construction: 1410 BB - 1342 BB

The southwestern tower, Sanctum Sortis, is a highly sacred place of worship for the god Solus and can only be entered with special permission. This is where the prophecy of darkness originated.

- 1410 BB: Construction of Sanctum Sortis begins. The still small and future "Monasterium Var Imperi" religious order starts building this place of worship relatively early.
- 1342 BB: Sanctum Sortis, including the bridge, is completed before the main tower.

### Arcem Alveus

Construction: 1501 BB - 1325 BB

The northeastern tower, Arcem Alveus, is essentially the city surrounding the Strakius spring. All important and official offices are located on the upper floors. In the lower, ground-level areas, there are markets, offices, accommodations, and many other departments.

- 1501 BB: Construction of the first tower of Strakius city begins.
- 1325 BB: The main construction work on the first tower of Strakius city is completed.

## History of Origin

Strakius, a respected wizard of his time and member of the great research council, wanted to find a safe way through the Aunarach desert as a pioneer of exploration. This was considered impossible at the time, and even the experienced inhabitants of Aunarach did not dare to venture more than a few tens of kilometers into the desert.

In 1517 BB, he finally set out with a massive caravan. The first weeks passed without major incidents, but the further they went, the more the desert seemed to turn against them. They repeatedly went off course or lost equipment and men in massive sandstorms.

After four months, only a handful of the once 250-strong troop remained, including Strakius. The situation was hopeless, as even his magic had no effect in the desert anymore.

They had wandered through the desert for a total of five and a half months until the few men who were still alive ran out of their last drop of water.

Dying, unable to produce even a single tear, Strakius began to conjure a spell he had never seen or read before, barely audible. A spell created from the pity of the desert itself. Finished with his last breath, he merged with the desert, and crystal-clear water began to gather at the spot where his body had been. A magical small lake, whose water did not evaporate and did not dry up, had formed in the middle of the desert.

Years later, in 1513 BB, when another explorer, Bolibere, set out to search for the remains of Strakius' mission, he and his men found the new spring shortly before dying of thirst. Since Strakius had never reappeared, and the bones of some of his men had been found but never his, the story of Strakius' sacrifice arose.

This spring became the key to crossing the desert.
