# Ports of Hybris

Location: Cheohk

The Ports of Hybris are located at the southernmost tip of Cheohk. They are one of the main docking points for ships coming from the Vast Waters. Around 493 BB, a completely new fishing industry developed, specializing in hunting, killing, and processing sea monsters. This quickly increased the international importance of the Ports of Hybris.

## History

## Sea Monster Fishing (Himlkoon)

The success of the unusual products was triggered by a team of adventurers who were commissioned by a small village to slay a sea monster that had been regularly attacking their fishermen during this time. Instead of simply killing the monster, an Antennariidae Titanus, known as a Giant Anglerfish, they lured it into a trap. The brave adventurers managed to tow the Giant Anglerfish behind their ship all the way to the Ports of Hybris.

There, the fish was lifted out of the water and killed. Afterward, it was gutted and the meat was sold cheaply. However, no one wanted the organs, and other more exotic parts initially remained unsold. It wasn't until word of the spectacular catch spread that some alchemists took notice, and quickly the unwanted remains became valuable raw materials, with demand skyrocketing.

The people of Hybris noticed this market gap that had opened up before them very quickly and reacted accordingly. Within a few years, dozens of fisheries specialized in this particular type of marine inhabitant and dragged larger and more abominable creatures ashore year after year.

Nevertheless, slaying these creatures remained an extremely dangerous undertaking. After all, these monstrosities were the reason why voyages through the Vast Waters were so perilous.

Thus, they fruitlessly cut their teeth on creatures like leviathans, titan krakens, monster crabs, even an ocean hydra, until they finally realized that some sea monsters were not worth fishing.

Among the fishermen and sailors, the hunted monsters were known as Himlkoon.
