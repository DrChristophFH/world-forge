# The Forelands

The Forelands, also known as the 10th Kingdom, is the most recent addition to the Arch-God Kingdom. Established in 64 BB, it serves as a crucial buffer zone between the civilized lands and the treacherous Land of Abominations to the north.

## History

### Conquest and Establishment

The creation of the Forelands began in 95 BB when military units started fortifying outposts in the Black Mountains. Recognizing the mountains' potential as a natural barrier, the northern army command decided to occupy the lands between the existing border and the mountains.

In 64 BB, a massive force of 800,000 men marched northward in a two-year campaign. This conquest was costly, claiming over 100,000 lives, but it successfully cleared the area of Abominations and established the new kingdom.

### Pre-Conquest Inhabitants

Prior to the Arch-God Kingdom's expansion, the area was largely infested with Abominations from the Dimensional Convergence 173 AB. The only human presence were Outcasts - criminals, traitors, and enemies of the state who had been exiled to this dangerous frontier. The Forelands were also used as a landfill site for all the "scum" long before the Dimensional Convergence. The military campaign not only secured the land but also eliminated this "blemish" on the kingdom's northern border.

## Geography

The Forelands consist of four Lordships:

1. **Araven Theel**: Located on the eastern side of the kingdom.
2. **[Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md)**: Situated in the very north, bordering the Black Mountains and the legendary Bulwarks.
3. **Letren**: Positioned in the western part of the kingdom.
4. **Trollfre**: Located above Letren in the northwest.

### Notable Geographical Features

- **[Black Mountains](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/Black-Mountains.md)**: Form the northern border of the Forelands, serving as a natural barrier against the Land of Abominations.
- **White Ridge**: A particularly high mountain range separating Araven Theel and Letren. It features an ancient tunnel system still in use today as the main route between the two Lordships. It was built way before the beginning of recorded history by some unknown inhabitants.
- **Devil's Hole**: Located in Araven Theel, it's the site where Aegolith and Pitchstone were discovered - key materials for constructing the Bulwarks.
- **Tidal Bridge**: A massive bridge built by the dwarves centuries ago, connecting the [Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md) to Vughdoruhl, a volcanic island to the east.
- **Troll Islands**: Abandoned islands west of Trollfre, once inhabited by humans but now overrun by trolls. Ruins of the former civilization are scattered across the islands.

## Political Structure

The Forelands are divided into four Lordships, each with its own capital:

1. **Letren**: The wealthiest Lordship, its capital Termenor Highcastle also serves as the kingdom's capital.
2. **Trollfre**: Second in wealth, with Highcalere Stronghold as its capital.
3. **Araven Theel**: Third in wealth, with Whitehaven Keep as its capital.
4. **[Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md)**: The least wealthy Lordship, with Wolvesley Castle as its capital.

### Political Dynamics

There's significant competition and political maneuvering between the Lordships, particularly involving Letren, Trollfre, and the [Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md). Araven Theel tends to be less involved in these disputes.

Trollfre, leveraging its connections to the then Arch-God King, secured the right to serve as the main transshipment point for supply caravans to the bulwarks, a decision that further strained relations with the [Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md).

## Culture and People

The Forelands are home to a diverse population. The people of the [Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md) are descendants of Outcasts and military personnel stationed there, giving them a unique culture of self-reliance and survival. The citizens of Letren are known for their wealth and stem mainly from high-ranking military personnel at the time of the conquest and settlers from the Arch-God Kingdom. Araven Theel has a mix of miners, traders, and craftsmen, while Trollfre lives primarily off the supply caravans passing through and their fertile lands.

### Economy and Trade

The Forelands play a crucial role in supplying the Bulwarks. The kingdom's economy is largely based on this strategic position, with Trollfre benefiting significantly from its status as the main transshipment point for caravans.

## Strategic Importance

The Forelands serve several critical functions for the Arch-God Kingdom:

1. **Buffer Zone**: It provides a populated, defended area between the core kingdoms and the Land of Abominations.
2. **Resource Production**: The discovery of Aegolith and Pitchstone in Araven Theel's Devil's Hole made the kingdom essential for the construction and maintenance of the Bulwarks.
3. **Supply Routes**: The kingdom is crucial for maintaining supply lines to the Bulwarks.
4. **Defensive Infrastructure**: The fortifications in the Black Mountains, including the legendary Bulwarks, form the kingdom's primary defense against Abominations.

## Notable Locations

- **Thunder Forge**: Located on Vughdoruhl, this legendary dwarven forge produces exceptional weapons, tools, and armor using the "fire of Eides itself." It should be noted that the forge is not located in the Forelands, but rather on Vughdoruhl, an island east of the [Grey Fields](/wiki/geography/eides/arch-god-kingdom/forelands/Grey-Fields.md), which does not stand under royal administration.
- **Bulwarks**: These legendary fortifications along the Black Mountains are the kingdom's - and indeed, the realm's - primary defense against the Abominations. They are also not under royal administration but are managed by the Bulwark Command and Arch-God Kingdom's military.

The Forelands, with its rich history, strategic importance, and unique culture, stands as a testament to the Arch-God Kingdom's power and ambition, serving as both a frontier and a bulwark against the dangers that lurk in the north.
