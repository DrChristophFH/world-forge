# Kingdom of Guilds

The Kingdom of Guilds is a unique political entity located in the far northwest of the Arch-God Kingdom, situated on a peninsula. Unlike the other nine kingdoms that comprise the Arch-God Kingdom, it is not divided into Lordships but rather into regions, each governed by a different guild.

## Government Structure

The Kingdom of Guilds is governed by a council formed by representatives from all guilds, with the seven Foundation Guilds holding the most significant influence. This system of governance sets it apart from the more traditional feudal structures found in other parts of the Arch-God Kingdom.

## The Seven Foundation Guilds

The seven most important and largest guilds, known as the Foundation Guilds, each have their own region and capital city:

1. Mages
   - Capital: Permagica
2. Smiths
   - Capital: Ignox
3. Carpenters
   - Capital: Spaang
4. Tailors
   - Capital: Fimble
5. Alchemists
   - Capital: Opus Magna
6. Inventors
   - Capital: Helios
7. Builders
   - Capital: Absolus

## Capital City

The capital of the entire Kingdom of Guilds is Absolus, which is also the capital of the Builders Guild. This choice of capital is fitting, given the Builders Guild's expertise in urban planning and construction.

## Other Guilds

While the seven Foundation Guilds form the backbone of the Kingdom's structure, numerous other guilds exist within this system. These smaller guilds are integrated into the regions of the Foundation Guilds based on their area of expertise or historical associations.

## Governance

The government of the Kingdom of Guilds is formed by representatives from all guilds, with the seven Foundation Guilds playing a central role. Decision-making is based on consensus and voting, with each guild having a say in matters that affect the Kingdom as a whole.

## Unique Features

1. Guild-based Governance: This system promotes specialization and excellence in various crafts and professions.
2. Lack of Traditional Nobility: The absence of Lordships leads to a more meritocratic society based on skill and guild membership rather than hereditary titles.
3. Collaborative Decision Making: The involvement of all guilds in governance likely leads to policies that consider a wide range of perspectives and expertise.
4. Economic Specialization: Each region, focused on a particular craft or profession, probably has a unique economic profile and specialized infrastructure.
