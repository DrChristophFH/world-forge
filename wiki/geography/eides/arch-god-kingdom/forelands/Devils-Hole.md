# Devil's Hole

The Devil's Hole is a significant geographical feature located in the very north of Lordship Araven Theel within the Forelands. It is a deep abyss, spanning approximately 1393 meters wide at the surface and extending down much further. The depth of the abyss is unknown, but it is believed to be at least several thousand meters deep. 

## Discovery and Significance

The Devil's Hole has been recorded on maps already in the ancient times, as it appears on maps predating Wereth's Last Cleansing. 

For a long time it has been of no particular interest to people, aside from being a natural landmark. However, it gained significant importance during the Age of Bulwarks when [Pitchstone](/wiki/objects/material/Pitchstone.md) and subsequently [Aegolith](/wiki/objects/material/Aegolith.md) were discovered in the walls of the abyss. 

## Geographical Features

The Devil's Hole is characterized by its steep, rocky walls that descend into darkness. The walls have a varying steepness between 80° and overhangs of 120° and more, making roping down the only way to explore the depths. 

The walls display a distinct transition in rock type and stability from the surface to the deeper zones. This stratification has been studied extensively since the Age of Bulwarks, when sustained exploration of the abyss began.

**Upper Rim Zone (0–50 m)**

The uppermost section consists primarily of weathered volcanic breccia and loose sedimentary infill. This material is highly fractured and prone to collapse, which makes traversing the area extremely dangerous. Sharp rock formations and loose debris can cause rockfalls, cut ropes, or even cause entire wall sections to collapse into the abyss.

**Transitional Zone (50–300 m)**

Beneath the rim lies a layer of welded volcanic tuff interspersed with fractured basalt flows. While still partially brittle, this rock exhibits greater cohesion than the material above. Iron oxide staining along fracture lines is common in this section, marking the movement of mineral-rich fluids through the rock in past ages.

**Stable Igneous Zone (300–800 m)**

This section is composed of massive columnar basalt formations and intersecting diabase dikes. The rock here is notably solid, providing secure anchoring for ropes and equipment. Early mining expeditions reached this depth before the discovery of significant [Aegolith](/wiki/objects/material/Aegolith.md) deposits further below.

**Metamorphosed Intrusion Zone (800–1500 m)**

At greater depth, the rock transitions into granodiorite and contact-metamorphosed basalt. This zone is where the first substantial [Aegolith](/wiki/objects/material/Aegolith.md) deposits occur, typically along ancient fault and fracture systems. The presence of [Pitchstone](/wiki/objects/material/Pitchstone.md) barriers sealing pressurized gas chambers is common in this layer, making extraction work hazardous. The surrounding rock is often heat-altered and glassy due to the [Aegolith](/wiki/objects/material/Aegolith.md)–rock reaction.

**Deep Reactive Zone (Below 1500 m)**

The lowest explored sections are composed of ultramafic rocks such as peridotite and serpentinite, sometimes heavily altered by fluid movement. Here, [Aegolith](/wiki/objects/material/Aegolith.md) occurs in the largest and most dangerous concentrations, encased within thick [Pitchstone](/wiki/objects/material/Pitchstone.md) layers and accompanied by extreme gas pressures. Several naturally ruptured chambers have been observed, their interiors coated in sharp [Pitchstone](/wiki/objects/material/Pitchstone.md) fragments. The origin of [Aegolith](/wiki/objects/material/Aegolith.md) in these deep formations remains a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.
