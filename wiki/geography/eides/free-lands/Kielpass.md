# Kielpass

The Kielpass, is a treacherous body of water located between the Land of Abominations and the northernmost part of Grim. This maritime passage is notorious for its dangerous waters, filled with unpredictable currents and hidden reefs, making it a perilous route for ships to navigate.

## Geography and Navigation

The exact boundaries of the Kielpass are not well-defined, but it generally encompasses the waters that separate the northern coast of Grim from the southern shores of the Land of Abominations. The pass is characterized by its complex underwater topography, which includes numerous rock formations that pose significant hazards to maritime traffic.

## Historical Significance

Historically, the Kielpass held some importance as a shipping route, especially for Grim, Pveil, Wrogia, Gloomrest and Elestenid before the formation of the [Free Lands](/wiki/geography/eides/Free-Lands.md) economic alliance. 

However, its usage as a major trade route was abandoned with the formation of the [Free Lands](/wiki/geography/eides/Free-Lands.md) 532 BB, as this alliance opened up alternative, safer routes for trade.

## Navigational Challenges

The Kielpass presents numerous challenges to sailors and ships attempting to traverse its waters:

1. **Outdated Sea Charts**: Most of the available sea charts for the Kielpass are severely outdated, with the most recent reliable maps dating back to 532 BB. This lack of current information makes navigation extremely risky.

2. **Underwater Hazards**: The pass is riddled with underwater rock formations that can easily damage or sink ships. These formations are known to shift over time, further complicating navigation.

3. **Unpredictable Currents**: Strong and erratic currents throughout the pass can easily push ships off course and into dangerous areas.

4. **Seasonal Changes**: The pass undergoes seasonal changes, particularly due to ice formation and movement. This adds another layer of unpredictability to its already treacherous nature.

5. **Icebergs**: Both surface and underwater icebergs pose significant threats to ships, especially during certain times of the year.

All this was further complicated during 173 BB, when the corruption of the Land of Abominations displaced the natural ice region that resided north of the Kielpass before the Dimensional Convergence. Only after the Eighth Dark Storm 355 AB and the destruction of the Weave Convergers had this ice settled again, ensuring that the natural movement of the Kielpass over the seasons occurred again. This gap of 500+ years where a lot of the natural movement of the Kielpass was missing led to the almost complete forgetting of the dangers of the Kielpass in the local population.

## Historical Events

The Kielpass played a crucial role in the ill-fated Operation Wisp in 458 AB. The Arch-God Kingdom attempted to use this route for a massive invasion fleet, hoping to surprise the Eastern Empire. However, the outdated charts and the pass's inherent dangers led to catastrophic losses, with only about 4 million of the original 10 million troops making it through completely. Of the remaining 6 million, half died in the pass, and the other half was scattered throughout the north around the Kielpass.

## Current Use

Today, the Kielpass is rarely used for maritime travel. The combination of its natural dangers and the lack of reliable navigational information makes it an unattractive route for most seafarers. Only a handful of local fishermen and perhaps the most daring of explorers venture into these waters, and even they do so with extreme caution.

## Cultural Impact

The treacherous nature of the Kielpass has led to its incorporation into local folklore and maritime legends. Stories of ghost ships, sea monsters, and lost treasures are often associated with these dangerous waters, adding to its mystique and foreboding reputation.
