# 1st Storm Guardian Company

## Overview

The 1st Storm Guardian Company stands as the elite special forces unit of the Bulwark of the Gods. Composed of the best of the best consecutive storm veterans, this company is entrusted with the critical mission of safeguarding scholars at the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md) and maintaining the lifeline between civilization and humanity's northernmost outpost.

## Mission and Duties

The primary responsibilities of the 1st Storm Guardian Company include:

1. Ensuring the security of scholars stationed at the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md)
2. Escorting scholars, supplies, and other essential resources between the Bulwark of the Gods and the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md)
3. Conducting high-risk operations in the Land of Abominations

## Structure and Rotation

The company is divided into eight platoons, each consisting of approximately 70 soldiers. These platoons operate on a monthly rotation cycle, ensuring constant vigilance and fresh troops at the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md). This rotation system also allows for regular supply runs and personnel changes between the Bulwark of the Gods and the [Storm Watch](/wiki/geography/eides/land-of-abominations/black-mountains/Storm-Watch.md).

During the time between 335 AB and 349 AB, the one-month rotation cycle was temporarily increased to a three-month cycle due to the lack of available personnel and the long span since the last Dark Storm.
