# Monasterium Var Imperi

The Monasterium Var Imperi is a secretive religious order that has amassed tremendous power over the centuries in the world of Eides. Despite not being the main religion in the [Arch-God Kingdom](/wiki/geography/eides/Arch-God-Kingdom.md) (AGK), its influence extends far beyond its official reach, making it a major player in the political and spiritual landscape of the known world.

## Overview

The full extent of the Monasterium Var Imperi's power and influence is unknown and remains a tightly guarded secret. This air of mystery contributes to the order's reputation and the respect (or fear) it commands from even the highest authorities in the land.

## Places of Worship

The Monasterium Var Imperi's places of faith are diverse, but the most prominent ones are known as "Sancti" (singular: Sanctum). These are independent buildings that only selected members of the order have access to. Some notable Sancti include:

1. [Sanctum Sortis](/wiki/geography/eides/kraikar/aunarach/Strakius.md#sanctum-sortis)
2. Sanctum Tauron Secundis
3. Sanctum Serata

These Sancti are not just places of worship but also symbols of the order's power and independence. The restricted access to these buildings further adds to the mystique surrounding the Monasterium Var Imperi.

## Political Influence

Theoretically, the Monasterium Var Imperi has no official influence or right of rule in most kingdoms of Eides. However, in practice, their power is such that even kings and the Arch-God King himself rarely dare to violate the order's rules or challenge its independence.

The reasons for this deference vary:
- Some rulers act out of fear of the unknown power the order might wield.
- Others, particularly most Arch-God Kings, show respect due to the order's perceived influence and importance.

This unofficial power allows the Monasterium Var Imperi to operate with a significant degree of autonomy across various kingdoms.

Another important point is that the Monasterium Var Imperi keeps itself out of politics and conflicts, at least this is how it seems for outsiders.

## Relationship with the Arch-God Kingdom

Despite its considerable influence, the Monasterium Var Imperi is not the main religion in the Arch-God Kingdom. This creates an interesting dynamic where a secretive order holds substantial sway over a kingdom with its own official religious structure.
