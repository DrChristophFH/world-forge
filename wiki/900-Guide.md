# Guide

I personally recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor for working on the World Forge wiki. It is free, open-source, and has excellent support for Markdown files, which is the format used for the wiki articles. But of course, you can use any text editor you prefer, or even work directly on GitHub in your web browser.

Once downloaded, you can clone the repository to your local machine using Git. If you are new to Git, I recommend reading the [Working with Git](/wiki/guides/Git.md) guide in the wiki.

The repository comes with a `.vscode` folder that contains settings for Visual Studio Code. When opening the repository in Visual Studio Code, you will be prompted to install the recommended extensions. These extensions enhance your editing experience, providing features like spell checking, Markdown preview, and more.
