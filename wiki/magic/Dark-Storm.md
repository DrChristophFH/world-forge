# Dark Storm

A Dark Storm is an arcane event whose exact origin has not yet been clarified. Thanks to the work of Barquin Prudenci, the storms can be predicted a few weeks in advance since the Fourth Dark Storm.

The storms manifest through an immense outburst of dark chaos energy, which is used by the hordes and armies of the Land of Abominations to attack the Land of Humans. Over a duration of usually ten to ninety days, a massive deep black storm rages across all of Eides, with accompanying phenomena ranging from blood rain and deep red lightning to firestorms.

Although the creatures from the Land of Abominations originate from Anoxis, the energy of a Dark Storm comes from Bargol. Whatever causes the storm, therefore, originates from Bargol.

## Trigger

A Dark Storm is triggered by Weave Convergers that ended up in the Land of Abominations during the great dimensional convergence there. Their origin lies in Bargol, where they are used in the war of the Dark Lords. However, it took almost 460 years before shadow arcanists discovered that there was still a connection to the Weave Convergers lost during the convergence. In a first attempt to activate these Weave Convergers in 286 AB, they triggered the first Dark Storm on Eides.

Through the cross-dimensional activation of the coupled Weave Convergers, the Magic Weave reacted with a violent backlash, which instantly drained vast amounts of chaos energy on the Bargol side. Due to this effect, the ignition of a coupled Weave Converger in Bargol was equivalent to the explosion of an atomic bomb. A competition among the Dark Lords began, and in the following 70 years, this weapon was used seven more times. Each time, a new Dark Storm was created.

The ninth Dark Storm differed from the previous ones in that it was activated from Eides. All Weave Convergers in Bargol were activated simultaneously, and with the help of the Abyss Amplifiers, the channel for the transferred chaos energy was immediately blown open.
