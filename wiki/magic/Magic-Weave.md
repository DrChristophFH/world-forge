# Magic Weave

The Magic Weave, often simply called the Weave, is the primary source of magic in our world. It surrounds everything, even the dimensions themselves.

## Forms of Energy

The energy forms manifest primarily in their respective dimensions but are not limited to them. They are suitable for various applications to different degrees. The following seven energy forms originate from the seven core planes:

1. Infernal Energy - Infernus
2. Blood Energy - Anoxis
3. Splinter Energy - Eterfröst
4. Flux Energy - Antikythera
5. Dark Chaos Energy - Bargol
6. Rune Energy - Glunoth
7. Arcane Energy - Eides

## Origins

In the beginning, as the original race of Eides, a powerful race lived in this world. Born from the Magic Weave itself, they were the very first to use magic.

These ancient beings, later known to the races that appeared on Eides as Viators, used the Weave to create a radiant civilization of wealth and knowledge. Due to their nature, they were able to use the Weave in ways no one else ever could. It was their way of shaping the Weave that gave it its name.

In what was later called the Bright Era of Magic, many Viators began to teach the various societies how to use the Magic Weave. Their long-forgotten method of weaving their will into the true essence of magic was strictly tied to the intellect and wisdom of the practitioner.

Although the Viators could create entire realms by shaping the Weave, the best that the brightest minds of their mortal scholars could achieve was the manipulation of hand-sized objects. Their minds were simply too limited for the Viators' type of magic.

## The Rise of New Magic

Driven by greed and anger over their failure and insignificant abilities compared to their nearly divine teachers, a group of former scholars began to search for alternative ways to use the Magic Weave according to their will.

It took many centuries before they developed a new technique that gave them access to the power of the Weave without requiring infinite wisdom. They began to recruit their own scholars, whom they instructed in the newly discovered magical powers.

The Viators were not pleased with this development, as this new technique irreversibly damaged the structure of the Magic Weave. But the leader of the wizards, Val Shovresk, defied the will of the Viators and continued to train new wizards. This led to a terrifying and brief battle known as the Battle of Val'kaárun.

In this battle, many Viators were killed, and those who remained recognized their mistake - the mistake of teaching the nature of magic to those who were too blinded by their own mortality to fully understand the implications of their actions.

With this realization, the Viators left Eides, leaving behind three artifacts more powerful than any magician. "The Three" were hidden and well-guarded by the Viators' scholars in three different locations.

## Legacy

The Magic Weave remains the foundation of all magical practices in our world. Its complex nature and the various energy forms it encompasses continue to be studied by scholars and mages alike. The departure of the Viators and the rise of new magical practices have forever changed how the Weave is understood and utilized, leaving a rich and sometimes contentious magical tradition in their wake.

The long history of Shovresk's form of magic being practiced by the various civilizations that followed the Viators has led to a continuous decrease in the quality of magic. Although a very slow process, the Magic Weave is slowly being destroyed by the misuse of magic. The Viators' magic was a way of shaping the Weave, while the new magic is a way of breaking it. Where during the time of the Viators, Shovresk's magic would allow to shape whole continents for normal wizards, it now would be considered an extraordinary feat for powerful wizards to create a small island.
