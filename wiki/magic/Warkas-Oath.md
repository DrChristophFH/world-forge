# Warkas Oath

Named after Warkas Ogirius, the Warkas Oath is a magical ritual primarily used by the assassins of Grim. This ritual allows the summoner to utilize Dark Chaos Energy through the Magic Weave.

## Ritual

### Power
The bound part of the consciousness can freely immerse itself in shadows and dark worlds, which is why assassins who have taken the Warkas Oath only feel comfortable in dim environments.

Additionally, this part of the consciousness is used to cast various spells using Dark Chaos Energy. However, this is often very simple magic, vastly inferior to that of a proper wizard.

### Binding
During the ritual, a part of the summoner's consciousness is bound to a parchment on which the words of the Oath are written. There are certain components that are identical in every oath, but a large part of the oath is different and secret for each individual.

For many assassins, the Warkas Oath becomes the most important object in their lives after completion, which is why they go to great lengths to ensure that no one else gets hold of it. Some carry it with them at all times, while others have locked it away in hidden vaults far away.

### Unbinding
Once bound, this part of consciousness is lost forever. If the parchment, which is often also simply just referred to as the Warkas Oath, is destroyed, this part of the consciousness dies. The summoner loses their powers and is often left as only a shadow of their former self.

Depending on the strength of the binding, it's even possible for a summoner to die after the destruction of their Warkas Oath.

### Warkas Betrayal
With knowledge of the exact wording of a Warkas Oath, it is possible to gain control over the bound part of consciousness through another ritual called the Warkas Betrayal. This is an extremely dark ritual that can be dangerous for the summoner. With this control, the summoner can gain insight into the thoughts of the betrayed, or even unconsciously influence them.
