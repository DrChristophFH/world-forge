# Dimensional Convergence

Dimensional convergence refers to the, often brief, collision of two or more dimensions. This frequently results in living beings, material, and energy transferring from one dimension to another.

## Known Dimensional Convergences

- 173 BB "Great Dimensional Convergence" Convergence in the north with Anoxis and Bargol
- 481 AB Agimon Draach's Dimensional Convergence

## Immense Energies

Since dimensions are fundamentally anchored in the surrounding Magic Weave, it requires a great deal of energy to bring them close enough together for a dimensional convergence to occur.

Once brought close enough together, a connection between the two worlds can form, establishing a kind of tunnel between them. This tunnel and the exchange of contents, which usually has a direction dependent on various factors including dimensional alignment, anchoring, etc., stabilizes the dimensions for a short time until the force of the Magic Weave becomes too great and the two dimensions are violently pulled apart, back to their anchor point.

Theoretically considered possible, but not proven, are dimensional merges, in which dimensions can build a tunnel large enough to withstand the force of the Magic Weave and eventually lead to a complete fusion of the two dimensions.
