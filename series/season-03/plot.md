# Season 3: "The Northern March" (95 BB - 17 BB)

## Season Overview

The reconquest season follows two interweaving storylines across 78 years of tumultuous history. The first chronicles the massive military campaign to reclaim the northern territories, beginning with the conquest of the Forelands and culminating in humanity's first attempts to establish fortifications in the treacherous Black Mountains. The second follows the political upheaval in Bivalon, where Princess Kathrina Belavere's ascension to the throne triggers an invasion from Fiendheim and subsequent internal conspiracy. Through these parallel narratives, we witness both the external struggle against the corrupted north and the internal fractures threatening the Arch-God Kingdom from within.

The season explores themes of moral ambiguity in warfare, the cost of expansion, and the delicate balance between justice and survival. As armies march north through increasingly hostile terrain, soldiers face impossible choices between following orders and maintaining their humanity. Meanwhile, in the political halls of Bivalon, a young street thief named Perseus navigates a world where loyalty, betrayal, and survival intersect in unexpected ways.

### Episode One: "The Crown and the Gutter"

The season opens in 95 BB during the reign of Queen Belavere, Kathrina's mother, in Bivalon. The episode centers on a public execution that will change young Perseus's life forever. We witness the solemn ceremony as an older thief faces death with dignity, requesting to die under the open sky according to tradition. As night falls, the haunting Song of Thieves echoes across the city's rooftops as dozens of figures silhouette against the starlight, paying their final respects. That same night, four-year-old Perseus is taken from the orphanage by the thieves, beginning his new life as part of their underground family. The episode shows Perseus's first year on the streets - the beatings from angry merchants, the protection of his new family, and his gradual understanding of the thieves' code and traditions.

Simultaneously, we witness the early stages of what will become the greatest military mobilization in the Arch-God Kingdom's history. Queen Belavere begins the initial planning for the northern reconquest, consulting with military advisors and sending envoys to coordinate with other kingdoms. In the royal court, young Princess Kathrina, barely older than Perseus, watches these preparations with curious eyes, not yet understanding the magnitude of what her mother is orchestrating. The episode establishes the innocence of childhood against the backdrop of growing ambitions, showing how both Perseus and Kathrina are shaped by forces beyond their understanding. As Perseus learns to pick pockets and navigate the criminal underworld, Kathrina absorbs lessons in statecraft and military strategy, both children unknowingly preparing for roles that will intertwine their fates years later.

### Episode Two: "Shadows of Fiendheim"

Several years have passed, and both Perseus and Kathrina have grown into young adults. Perseus, now in his early twenties, has become one of the most skilled thieves in Bivalon, specializing in the path of a master thief under the tutelage of the guild's most experienced members. His training in the six disciplines - pickpocketing, burglary, safe-cracking, acrobatics, stealth, and social infiltration - has reached an advanced level, making him capable of complex operations that require multiple skill sets. The episode shows Perseus executing a sophisticated heist that demonstrates his growth from the frightened orphan we met in the first episode to a confident, capable young man who has found his place in the world.

This episode marks the beginning of the great march north as armies from across the Arch-God Kingdom finally mobilize. The massive force includes not only troops from the heartland but significant contingents from Bivalon and other allied kingdoms. We follow the departure ceremonies as thousands of soldiers bid farewell to their families, with Bivalon contributing a substantial portion of its military strength to the campaign. Even Fiendheim, as part of their obligations to the Arch-God Kingdom, provides troops for the northern expedition, though their contribution is deliberately minimal. The episode captures the excitement and trepidation as the largest army in generations begins its long journey north through the kingdom of Hochcordt. Meanwhile, in Fiendheim's royal court, King Hainriech Latakallourd and his advisors watch the departing armies with calculating eyes, recognizing the opportunity that Bivalon's weakened state presents. The episode ends with Fiendheim's secret military preparations beginning, hidden from their allies and timed to coincide with Bivalon's reduced defensive capabilities.

### Episode Three: "The Battle of Darenfeld"

Tragedy strikes as Queen Belavere dies unexpectedly, leaving young Kathrina to inherit the throne during the most vulnerable moment in Bivalon's recent history. With the kingdom's military strength committed to the northern campaign and now passing through Hochcordt's mountain ranges, Fiendheim sees the perfect opportunity to strike. King Hainriech Latakallourd's gamble is audacious and morally reprehensible - using the tactical advantage gained from their allies' trust to launch an invasion while Bivalon is weakened. If successful, Fiendheim believes they can present the Arch-God Kingdom with a fait accompli, hoping that economic sanctions and political scolding will be a price worth paying for territorial expansion.

Perseus, despite the thieves' traditional separation from politics and nobility, cannot stand by as his homeland faces invasion. Through the underground network's intelligence gathering, he learns of Fiendheim's approaching army and makes the unprecedented decision to warn the new queen. Kathrina, barely on the throne and facing skeptical nobles who doubt both her inexperience and the credibility of intelligence from criminals, struggles to convince her court to mobilize. Many nobles argue that mobilization would be provocative and that Fiendheim would never dare attack an ally. Unable to reveal her source without compromising Perseus and the thieves, Kathrina makes the difficult decision to gather what forces she can and march to meet the threat. The Battle of Darenfeld becomes a catastrophic confrontation where both armies are nearly annihilated. Despite Kathrina's tactical acumen, Bivalon's hastily assembled forces are defeated, and the young queen is captured and taken across the border to Fiendheim. However, Fiendheim's pyrrhic victory leaves them too weakened to pursue further conquest, forcing them to retreat and consolidate their gains. The episode ends with both kingdoms counting their devastating losses and Bivalon left leaderless and vulnerable.

### Episode Four: "The Iron Fist"

In the power vacuum left by Kathrina's capture, a ruthless opportunist seizes control of Bivalon's government. This unnamed tyrant, driven by greed and paranoia, establishes a reign of terror that makes the kingdom's defeat seem like a minor tragedy in comparison. Houses are plundered under the pretense of rooting out traitors, their wealth confiscated to fund the new regime's ambitions. Citizens disappear in the night, imprisoned without charges or trial, while public executions become daily occurrences designed to intimidate any potential opposition. The episode shows how quickly a society can descend into brutality when fear replaces justice as the governing principle.

Perseus and his thief family watch in horror as their world collapses around them. The new ruler views the thieves not as a necessary evil to be tolerated, but as a cancer to be excised completely. Without the protection that the previous monarchs had tacitly provided, thieves are hunted down with unprecedented efficiency. Those caught face immediate execution without the traditional trial or the dignity of dying under the open sky. Day by day, Perseus's family shrinks as members are captured, killed, or forced to flee the kingdom entirely. The Song of Thieves, once a symbol of continuity and hope, becomes a nightly dirge for the dead and disappeared. Meanwhile, in the north, the Arch-God Kingdom's army has successfully traversed Hochcordt's treacherous mountain passes and begun encountering the first settlements in the corrupted territories. The contrast between the army's progress toward their noble goal and Bivalon's descent into tyranny highlights the season's theme about how easily civilization can be corrupted from within. The episode ends with Perseus making a desperate decision: he will find a way to rescue Kathrina and restore legitimate rule to Bivalon, even if it means venturing into enemy territory.

### Episode Five: "Blood in the Snow"

Perseus embarks on his most dangerous mission yet: infiltrating Fiendheim to locate and rescue the captured Queen Kathrina. Accompanied by his closest companions from the thief family - those few who remain alive and free - he crosses the border using skills honed over years of training. The episode showcases Perseus at his peak abilities as he employs all six thieving disciplines to navigate enemy territory. The group must avoid Fiendheim patrols, gather intelligence from local criminals and outcasts, and gradually piece together information about Kathrina's location. This parallel journey becomes a study in loyalty and sacrifice, as Perseus risks everything not for personal gain but for the restoration of justice to his homeland.

Meanwhile, the northern army faces its own moral crisis as it encounters settlements in the corrupted territories that challenge every assumption about their mission. Villages filled with families who have lived in these lands for generations present soldiers with an impossible choice: follow orders to "cleanse" the territory or acknowledge the humanity of those they're meant to eliminate. The episode doesn't flinch from showing the atrocities committed in the name of reclamation, with mass graves and burned settlements marking the army's path. A young officer's refusal to participate in a village massacre leads to his court-martial and execution, witnessed by horrified soldiers who begin questioning the very nature of their cause. The parallel between Perseus's heroic mission to save an innocent queen and the army's increasingly dark actions in the north creates a powerful contrast between individual conscience and institutional momentum. Both storylines explore how good people can find themselves complicit in evil through the simple act of following orders or accepting the status quo.

### Episode Six: "The Shadow of the Mountains"

Perseus's rescue mission reaches its climax as he successfully locates and frees Queen Kathrina from her Fiendheim prison. The episode showcases the culmination of his training as a master thief, combining stealth, social manipulation, and precise timing to achieve what seems impossible. However, their escape from Fiendheim proves more perilous than anticipated, as King Hainriech's forces pursue them across the border. The journey back to Bivalon becomes a running battle of wits, with Perseus using every trick learned on the streets to keep them ahead of their pursuers. Kathrina, meanwhile, reveals her own growth during captivity - the naive young woman who lost the Battle of Darenfeld has become a hardened leader with a clear vision for reclaiming her throne.

Simultaneously, the northern army finally reaches the Black Mountains, the massive range of dark stone that forms a natural barrier between civilization and the unknown lands beyond. The sight is both magnificent and terrifying – towering peaks that seem to absorb light itself, stretching across the entire northern horizon. For the first time in months, the army's mood improves as they transition from the brutal work of "cleansing" to the construction work of fortification. Soldiers find purpose in chopping trees, building watchtowers, and establishing the first camps along the mountain range's southern edge. The episode captures the relief of men who can finally build something instead of destroying it, though this respite proves temporary as the mountains begin to reveal their supernatural nature. Scout patrols start disappearing without trace, and strange sounds echo from the dark peaks at night, hinting at the challenges to come.

### Episode Seven: "Echoes in the Dark"

Perseus and Kathrina return to a Bivalon they barely recognize, transformed by months of tyrannical rule into a kingdom living in fear. The episode shows their shock as they witness the systematic destruction of everything they once knew: empty streets where vibrant markets once thrived, boarded-up houses of families that have fled or been "disappeared," and giblets displaying the remains of those who dared resist. The tyrant's reign has not only eliminated the thieves but has also driven away merchants, artisans, and anyone with the means to escape. Kathrina realizes that simply reclaiming her throne will not be enough - she must rebuild an entire society that has been terrorized into submission.

Working in secret, Perseus attempts to reconnect with surviving members of the thief family while Kathrina reaches out to the few nobles who might still support her cause. However, their efforts to organize resistance are discovered by the tyrant's increasingly paranoid security apparatus. In a heartbreaking twist, Perseus is captured during a meeting with potential allies, betrayed by someone he trusted. As he faces imprisonment and certain execution, Perseus makes a final sacrifice - he refuses to reveal the names of his surviving companions or Kathrina's hiding place, even under torture. Meanwhile, in the Black Mountains, the supernatural forces inhabiting the peaks intensify their response to the human presence. Fortifications crumble overnight, weapons turn against their wielders, and entire companies vanish without explanation. The episode builds toward dual climaxes as both storylines reach their darkest moments: Perseus facing death in a Bivalon dungeon while hundreds of miles north, soldiers flee in terror from enemies they cannot comprehend or fight.

### Episode Eight: "The Last Song"

The season concludes with Perseus's execution becoming the catalyst that finally galvanizes opposition to the tyrant's rule. Despite being denied the traditional dignity of dying under the open sky, Perseus faces death with courage, his final words inspiring those who witness his end. That night, the surviving thieves gather on whatever rooftops they can safely reach, their voices joining in the Song of Thieves that echoes across the oppressed city. This act of defiance becomes a rallying cry for all those who have suffered under tyrannical rule, as citizens begin emerging from their homes to support what becomes a popular uprising. Kathrina, using intelligence networks and resistance contacts established during Perseus's final weeks, coordinates the rebellion that sweeps the tyrant from power.

The episode reveals how Perseus's actions during his captivity, including evidence he gathered and messages he smuggled out before his capture, provide Kathrina with the political ammunition needed to expose the tyrant's crimes and rally legitimate opposition. His sacrifice transforms him from a criminal outcast into a folk hero whose story inspires others to risk everything for justice. As Kathrina reclaims her throne, she honors Perseus's memory by officially establishing the Queen's Thieves as a recognized intelligence service, legitimizing the underground network that saved her kingdom. In the north, the military campaign reaches its inevitable conclusion as supernatural attacks intensify beyond any hope of resistance. The great army that began the season hundreds of thousands strong finds itself systematically pushed back from the Black Mountains, unable to maintain any fortification beyond the first ridge. The episode ends with both storylines achieving resolution: Kathrina's restoration brings justice back to Bivalon while the northern withdrawal teaches crucial lessons about the nature of the forces defending the corrupted lands. As the season closes, a new orphan is taken in by the surviving thieves, ensuring the cycle continues, while Samuel Kiligrew's diplomatic efforts finally resolve the broader conflict with Fiendheim through economic agreements that address the root causes of regional instability.
