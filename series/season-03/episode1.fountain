FADE IN:

INT. DUNGEON - DUSK

A dimly lit dungeon, the walls damp and cold. Shadows flicker as a single torch sputters on the wall. The sound of dripping water echoes through the silence.

LOUD ECHOING FOOTSTEPS approach. The heavy iron door CREAKS open into the cell. The light from the outside reveals a bone-thin figure, chained to the wall. He looks up, his face furrowed and weary.

Guards enter, their armor clanking. One unlocks the chains, the others immediately grab the figure, pulling him to his feet, his legs trembling as they drag him out.

EXT. COURTYARD - DUSK

A large, open courtyard filled with soldiers and townsfolk. A gallows stands ominously in the center. The crowd chatters eagerly, some with anticipation in their eyes, others with a somber expression.

A small wooden scaffold stands next to the gallows. On it three judges, and two guards, all in dark robes, await the arrival of the prisoner.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - DUSK

A hooded figure watches from the shadows of a nearby rooftop, observing the scene below.

EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

The prisoner is brought before the scaffold, his face pale but defiant. The guards push him forward, and he stumbles but catches himself. The crowd quiets as the lead JUDGE stands.

EXT. DARK STREETS - DUSK

A few silhouettes move stealthily through the shadows, their faces hidden.

EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

JUDGE
(to the crowd)
People of Calden, today we shall pronounce judgment upon this...

PRISONER
(raising his head)
Very innocent person.

The guards holding him immediately press the prisoners head down. The judge looks down at the prisoner in annoyance, but the crowd murmurs, some laughing, others shaking their heads. The prisoner smiles faintly.

JUDGE
Oh, you think you are innocent?

The judge directs himself to the crowd.

JUDGE
Is it innocent to steal thousands of gold in savings of the people?
Is it innocent to steal medicine desperately needed by the sick?
Is it innocent to cripple three common folk for the rest of their lives, just because they dared to protect women and children?

The crowd grows restless. Their booing and hissing grows louder. Stones and mud are thrown at the prisoner, who stands defiantly, his head held high.

JUDGE
All your life you have known nothing but to steal.

PRISONER
So you steal from me now, when I have only my life to give.

JUDGE
You lie correct. The judgment is death.

The crowd erupts in cheers and shouts. The guards pull the prisoner towards the gallows.

PRISONER
WAIT!

The guards stop. The crowd quiets, curious.

JUDGE
Last words?

PRISONER
A last request, in the face of death.

JUDGE
Speak.

PRISONER
Let me whistle a last tune, before the ground beneath me gives way.

The judge hesitates. He looks to the guard to his right as if seeking permission. The guard nods slightly, and the judge turns back to the prisoner.

JUDGE
Granted. With the last tone you will leave this world.

The guards proceed to bring him up to the gallows. The prisoner stands on the platform, his hands tied behind his back. He takes a deep breath, his eyes scanning the crowd. The guards prepare the noose, tightening it around his neck.

Then the prisoner starts to whistle a haunting melody, the sound echoing through the courtyard. The crowd falls silent, captivated by the tune.

As the last note hangs in the air, the judge nods to the guards. They pull the lever, and the platform beneath the prisoner gives way. The rope tightens, and he hangs lifelessly.

But the melody hasn't stopped. It grows louder, echoing over the courtyard, filling the air with an eerie beauty. The crowd watches in awe as hooded figures on the rooftops begin to whistle along, the sound blending with the haunting melody.
