# Season 2: "The Great Convergence" (173 BB)

## Season Overview

The most catastrophic season in the series, depicting the Great Dimensional Convergence that forever changes the world. Reality itself is torn apart as dimensions collide, transforming the northern lands into the nightmarish Land of Abominations.

Difficulties with the new coalition between the Kingdoms in the east. They have come together in a loose alliance called "Union of the Free Lands", mostly opening their borders to each other, improving trade and communication. This leads to a period of new trade routes and cultural exchange in the midsea. Trivalon is accumulating wealth and power through their ports. This causes tensions within the Arch-God Kingdom. Eventually leads to the split of Trivalon into Trivalon and Neuhaven, as the latter is founded by the Arch-God King to counterbalance the growing power of Trivalon.
